Morning lads, quick update from the Ballymun site. Concrete delivery arrived today at 30. 45 cubic metres of C25/30 ready-mix. Cost came to â‚¬2,850 including delivery. Driver said they'll need the pump truck positioned by 10am for the foundation pour. Steel fixers finished the rebar installation yesterday evening. Used 3.2 tonnes of 12mm and 16mm reinforcement bar. Everything's looking good for today's pour. Weather forecast shows rain starting around 2pm. So we need to get this done before then. Foundation cover 180 square metres. Should take about 4 hours to complete. Safe to check this morning. Found one issue. Temporary edge protection on the north side needs reinforcing before we start. Jimmy's sorting that now. Materials for next week. 200 concrete blocks, 7N. 15 bags of cement. 50 tonnes sand and aggregate waterproofing membrane for the basement. Structural engineer is coming Friday morning to inspect before we move to the next phase. All going well. We'll have the ground floor slab ready by the end of the month. Let me know if you need anything else. Weather permitting, this should be a good day for the pour. JP McCarty. Safe farming.
