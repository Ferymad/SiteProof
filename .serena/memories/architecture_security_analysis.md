# Critical Architecture Security Analysis

## CRITICAL SECURITY VIOLATION IDENTIFIED

### Problem Description
OpenAI client being initialized in frontend components, causing browser security error:
```
Error: It looks like you're running in a browser-like environment.
This is disabled by default, as it risks exposing your secret API credentials to attackers.
```

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **lib/openai.ts** - OpenAI client initialized at module level
2. **lib/services/transcription-fixer.ts** - Imports OpenAI client directly
3. **lib/services/smart-suggestion.service.ts** - Imports transcription service
4. **components/ProcessingStatus.tsx** - Imports smart suggestion service
5. **pages/index.tsx** - Renders components that chain-import OpenAI

### Security Risk Assessment
- **CRITICAL**: API keys exposed to browser environment
- **CRITICAL**: Client-side execution of sensitive API calls
- **HIGH**: Violation of secure API key handling practices
- **MEDIUM**: Business logic mixed with presentation layer

### Affected Components
- OpenAI client configuration
- Transcription fixing service (Story 1A.2.1)
- Smart suggestion service (Story 1A.2.2)
- ProcessingStatus component
- SmartSuggestionReview component

### Business Impact
- MVP completely broken - cannot process transcriptions
- Story 1A.3 (Evidence Package Generation) blocked
- All AI processing functionality non-functional
