## 🎨 Frontend Technologies

### 🔴 SSR/SSG (Server-Side Rendering / Static Site Generation)
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Different ways to build web pages
- **SSR**: Page built on server when user visits (like cooking food to order)
- **SSG**: Pages pre-built ahead of time (like meal prep)
- **Client-Side**: Page built in user's browser (like ordering ingredients to cook at home)

**🚨 CONFUSION ALERT - SSR vs SSG vs Client-Side:**
- **SSR**: Server cooks page fresh each time (slower but always current)
- **SSG**: Pre-cooked pages served instantly (fastest but content might be stale)
- **Client-Side**: User's browser cooks the page (slowest initial load, but interactive)

**Popular Frameworks You Might Know:**
- **Gatsby** - SSG focused (many blogs use this)
- **Nuxt.js** - Vue.js equivalent of Next.js
- **SvelteKit** - Svelte's answer to Next.js
- **Remix** - New competitor to Next.js

**Why We Chose This for Your App:**
- **SSR for Main App**: Construction workers on 3G in remote sites need fast page loads
- **SSG for Marketing**: Landing pages load instantly even with poor signal
- **Hybrid Approach**: Next.js automatically optimizes each page type

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Paddy is in a muddy trench in Cork with 1 bar of signal. When he opens the app to log concrete work, SSR ensures the page loads in 2 seconds instead of 10. Meanwhile, your marketing site uses SSG so potential customers get instant loading."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Mobile-first users with poor connectivity
- Need instant access during time-critical work
- Marketing site needs to work everywhere for lead generation

**When Developers Mention It:** "Should we SSR this page for better mobile performance?"

### 🟡 TypeScript
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** JavaScript with safety rules
- **JavaScript**: `let amount = "50 tons"` (could accidentally become a number later)
- **TypeScript**: `let amount: string = "50 tons"` (enforces it stays text)

**🚨 CONFUSION ALERT - TypeScript vs JavaScript:**
- **JavaScript**: The original language (like writing without spellcheck)
- **TypeScript**: JavaScript + type safety (like writing with spellcheck)
- **Think of it**: TypeScript = JavaScript wearing a safety helmet

**Similar Concepts You Might Know:**
- **Flow** - Facebook's version of TypeScript (less popular now)
- **PropTypes** - React's old way of type checking
- **JSDoc** - Adding type comments to JavaScript
- **Dart** - Google's typed language (Flutter uses this)

**Why We Chose This for Your App:**
- **Prevents Field Errors**: €50,000 concrete claim can't have a typo in amount field
- **Team Scaling**: New developers understand code immediately
- **Integration Safety**: Main contractor APIs must receive exact data format

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Your app processes '€50,000' as a string but contractor system expects 50000 as number. TypeScript catches this before deployment, preventing a rejected claim and angry client."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- High-stakes financial data (construction claims)
- Multiple developers will join team as you scale
- External system integrations must be bulletproof

**When Developers Mention It:** "The TypeScript errors are preventing deployment"

---

### 🟡 Radix UI
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Pre-built accessible UI components
- **Problem**: Building dropdowns, modals from scratch is complex
- **Solution**: Radix provides tested, accessible components
- **Your Benefit**: Faster development, better accessibility

**Why We Chose This for Your App:**
- **Legal Compliance**: EU accessibility laws require screen reader support
- **Touch-First Design**: Construction workers use phones with work gloves
- **Rapid Development**: Pre-tested components = faster MVP delivery

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Blind quantity surveyor at main contractor uses screen reader to review your evidence packages. Radix components ensure proper ARIA labels, so he can navigate and approve claims without assistance."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- European accessibility regulations are strict
- Construction workers often wear gloves that affect touch sensitivity
- Small team needs to build UI fast without accessibility expertise

**When Developers Mention It:** "Should we use the Radix dialog component?"

---

### 🔴 Zustand (State Management)
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** How the app remembers things across different pages
- **Problem**: User logs in, but app forgets on next page
- **Solution**: Zustand stores user info, current project, etc.
- **Alternative**: Redux (more complex), Context API (slower)

**Popular Alternatives You Might Know:**
- **Redux** - Like Zustand but with more ceremony (Netflix, Airbnb use this)
- **MobX** - Different approach, more automatic updates
- **Vuex** - Vue.js equivalent (if you know Vue)
- **Context API** - Built into React, simpler but slower

**Why We Chose This for Your App:**
- **Site Switching**: PMs work on 3-5 projects, need instant switching
- **Offline Resilience**: Remember current project when signal drops
- **Simple for Team**: Django developers can understand React state easily

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Seamus manages Kilkenny Hospital (main project) and Trinity College extension (side project). He switches between them 10+ times daily. Zustand remembers which project he's viewing, even if he loses signal walking between buildings."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Multi-project workflows are core to construction PMs
- Mobile signal loss is frequent on construction sites
- Small team needs simple, maintainable patterns

**When Developers Mention It:** "Let's store the active project in Zustand"

---

### 🔴 React Query (Server State Caching)
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Smart way to handle data from your backend
- **Without React Query**: Fetch project list every page load
- **With React Query**: Remember project list, refresh when needed
- **Benefits**: Faster app, works offline, automatic retries

**🚨 CONFUSION ALERT - Zustand vs React Query:**
- **Zustand (Client State)**: Remembers UI stuff (which tab is open, user preferences)
- **React Query (Server State)**: Remembers data from backend (project lists, user profiles)
- **Think of it**: Zustand = your brain's short-term memory, React Query = your phone's contact list

**Popular Alternatives You Might Know:**
- **SWR** - Similar to React Query, by Vercel (simpler but less features)
- **Apollo Client** - For GraphQL APIs (like React Query but for GraphQL)
- **RTK Query** - Redux version of React Query

**Why We Chose This for Your App:**
- **Expensive Mobile Data**: Construction sites often use mobile hotspots
- **Instant Project Switching**: Cached project data = no waiting
- **Poor Signal Reliability**: Auto-retry essential for remote sites

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Mary opens the Galway Hospital project at 8am (downloads data). At 2pm in basement with no signal, she can still review morning's voice messages from cache. When signal returns, React Query auto-syncs any changes."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Construction sites have expensive/limited data plans
- Workers move between signal dead zones constantly
- Historical project data is frequently referenced

**When Developers Mention It:** "React Query is handling the project data caching"

---

### 🟡 CDN (Content Delivery Network)
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Your app's files stored closer to users
- **Problem**: Irish user downloading from US server = slow
- **Solution**: CDN puts app files on Irish servers
- **Result**: Faster loading times globally

**Why We Chose This for Your App:**
- **EU Coverage**: Fast loading from Cork to Edinburgh to Amsterdam
- **Mobile-First**: Construction sites have slow 3G, CDN compensates
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces data transfer costs from primary servers

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Dutch contractor accesses your app from Amsterdam job site. Instead of slow connection to Irish server, Vercel CDN serves cached files from Netherlands edge server - 50ms instead of 200ms load time."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- European construction market (Ireland, UK, Netherlands)
- Mobile-first users on slow connections need every millisecond
- International expansion planned for European contractors

**When Developers Mention It:** "Vercel's CDN is handling our static assets"

---

## 🔧 Backend Technologies

### 🟡 REST API Framework
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Standardized way for frontend and backend to communicate
- **GET /projects** = "Show me all projects"
- **POST /projects** = "Create a new project"
- **PUT /projects/123** = "Update project 123"
- **DELETE /projects/123** = "Delete project 123"

**Popular Alternatives You Might Know:**
- **GraphQL** - More flexible queries (Facebook created this, GitHub uses it)
- **gRPC** - Faster but more complex (Google created this)
- **SOAP** - Older, more formal (banks still use this)
- **tRPC** - TypeScript-specific (what T3 stack uses)

**🚨 CONFUSION ALERT - REST vs GraphQL:**
- **REST**: Multiple endpoints (/projects, /users, /messages)
- **GraphQL**: Single endpoint, ask for exactly what you need
- **Think of it**: REST = ordering from menu, GraphQL = custom meal ordering

**Why We Chose This for Your App:**
- **Contractor Systems**: Procore, PlanGrid use standard REST APIs
- **Developer Hiring**: Every backend developer knows REST patterns
- **Mobile Future**: Native iOS/Android apps will use same endpoints

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Walls & Ceilings Ltd wants to integrate your evidence data into their existing Procore setup. Their IT team looks at your REST API docs and completes integration in 2 days instead of 2 weeks."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Construction industry uses standard software (Procore, PlanGrid)
- Small development team needs universally understood patterns
- Future partnerships require easy integration capabilities

**When Developers Mention It:** "The REST endpoint for processing messages is ready"

---

### 🔴 Redis (Caching & Task Queues)
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Super-fast temporary storage
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data in memory (milliseconds vs seconds)
- **Task Queues**: Handle background jobs (voice processing, PDF generation)
- **Sessions**: Remember who's logged in

**🚨 CONFUSION ALERT - Redis vs PostgreSQL:**
- **PostgreSQL (Database)**: Permanent storage, like a filing cabinet (projects, users, messages)
- **Redis (Cache)**: Temporary fast storage, like your desk (frequently used stuff)
- **Think of it**: PostgreSQL = bank vault, Redis = your wallet

**Popular Alternatives You Might Know:**
- **Memcached** - Similar caching, simpler than Redis
- **RabbitMQ** - Task queues only (no caching)
- **Amazon ElastiCache** - AWS managed Redis
- **Google Cloud Memorystore** - Google's managed Redis

**Why We Chose This for Your App:**
- **Friday Rush**: Multiple PMs upload voice messages at 4pm deadline
- **Database Protection**: Cache frequent queries (project lists, user data)
- **Task Coordination**: Queue voice processing jobs fairly

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Friday 4pm: 5 PMs across Ireland upload 20 voice messages each for weekly claims. Redis queues all 100 jobs, processes them in parallel, and caches the project lists so the UI stays responsive during the rush."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Weekly deadline creates predictable traffic spikes
- Voice processing is CPU-intensive and must be queued
- Multiple users need instant access to shared project data

**When Developers Mention It:** "The Redis queue is processing 10 voice messages"

---

### 🔴 Django-Q (Task Processing)
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Handles time-consuming work in the background
- **Problem**: Voice transcription takes 30 seconds, user can't wait
- **Solution**: Django-Q processes it in background, notifies when done
- **Uses Redis**: For storing and managing the task queue

**🚨 CONFUSION ALERT - Django-Q vs Redis:**
- **Redis**: The storage system (like a todo list notebook)
- **Django-Q**: The worker who reads the notebook and does the tasks
- **Think of it**: Redis = job board, Django-Q = the employees doing the jobs

**Popular Alternatives You Might Know:**
- **Celery** - More popular but more complex (Instagram, Pinterest use this)
- **RQ (Redis Queue)** - Simpler than Celery, similar to Django-Q
- **Sidekiq** - Ruby equivalent (if you know Ruby on Rails)
- **Bull Queue** - Node.js equivalent (if you know JavaScript)

**Why We Chose This for Your App:**
- **Long Processing**: Voice transcription takes 15-45 seconds per message
- **Site Workflow**: Can't wait - need to move to next task immediately
- **Reliability**: If OpenAI fails, job retries with Replicate backup

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Liam uploads 3-minute voice message about rebar installation at 4:55pm on Friday. Django-Q processes it in background while he photographs the work. By 5:02pm, transcribed data is ready for review - he doesn't miss his weekend."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Construction work happens in short bursts between other tasks
- Friday evening deadline means no time to wait for processing
- AI services sometimes fail, need automatic fallback

**When Developers Mention It:** "Django-Q worker crashed, voice processing is down"

---

### 🟡 Railway vs Vercel
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Different hosting platforms with different strengths

**Vercel:**
- **Best For**: Frontend React/Next.js apps
- **Strengths**: Global CDN, automatic optimizations, easy deployments
- **Weakness**: Limited backend support, expensive for high CPU usage

**Railway:**
- **Best For**: Backend Django apps, databases, background tasks
- **Strengths**: Better Python support, persistent storage, Redis included
- **Weakness**: Less global optimization than Vercel

**Why We Chose Split Deployment:**
- **Best of Both**: Vercel's global CDN + Railway's Python/Django expertise
- **Cost Optimization**: €45/month vs €200+ for single premium platform
- **Fault Tolerance**: Frontend works even if backend has issues

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Saturday morning: Railway backend crashes during deployment. Your marketing site (Vercel) still works, so new customers can sign up. Frontend shows cached project data while backend restarts. Users barely notice the 5-minute backend outage."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Startup budget requires cost optimization
- Construction industry works weekends - 99.9% uptime critical
- Marketing site must always work for lead generation

**When Developers Mention It:** "Railway deployment failed, backend is down"

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

### 🔴 JWT Tokens
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Digital passport that proves who you are
- **Structure**: Header.Payload.Signature (encoded data + security signature)
- **Contains**: User ID, permissions, expiration time
- **Verification**: Server checks signature to ensure it's not fake

**Why We Chose This for Your App:**
- **Multi-Device**: Same user on phone + tablet + office computer
- **Offline Capability**: Token works when disconnected from server
- **Contractor Integration**: Main contractors can validate your users

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Niamh logs in on phone at site, reviews data on tablet in site office, then creates final report on desktop at home. JWT token works across all devices without requiring internet connection to validate."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Construction workers use multiple devices throughout day
- Signal loss is common, need offline-capable authentication
- Future integrations require industry-standard auth tokens

**When Developers Mention It:** "JWT token expired, user needs to re-login"

---

### 🟡 Middleware
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Security guard that checks every request
- **Before Request**: Check if user is logged in, has permission
- **After Request**: Log the action, add security headers
- **Examples**: Authentication, rate limiting, CORS

**Why We Chose This for Your App:**
- **Audit Trail**: Legal requirement to track who approved what claim
- **Rate Protection**: Prevent abuse during busy Friday submission periods
- **Multi-Tenant Security**: Ensure companies only see their own data

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Auditor questions €75,000 concrete claim from 6 months ago. Middleware logs show exactly who uploaded evidence (Paddy), who validated it (Sarah), and when main contractor accessed it. Full audit trail for legal compliance."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Construction industry heavily regulated (audit requirements)
- High-value claims need complete traceability
- Multi-company platform needs bulletproof data separation

**When Developers Mention It:** "Middleware is blocking that API request"

---

### 🔴 Real-time (WebSockets/Supabase Realtime)
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Instant updates without refreshing the page
- **Traditional**: Click refresh button to see new data
- **Real-time**: New data appears automatically
- **Technology**: WebSocket connection stays open

**🚨 CONFUSION ALERT - Real-time vs Webhooks:**
- **Real-time**: Your app pushes updates to users (app → users)
- **Webhooks**: External services push updates to your app (WhatsApp → your app)
- **Think of it**: Real-time = loudspeaker announcements, Webhooks = doorbell ringing

**Popular Alternatives You Might Know:**
- **Socket.io** - Popular WebSocket library (Slack, WhatsApp Web use this)
- **Pusher** - Hosted real-time service (easier but costs more)
- **Firebase Realtime Database** - Google's real-time solution
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** - Simpler, one-way updates

**Why We Chose This for Your App:**
- **Instant Validation**: Validators in Dublin see Cork PM's upload immediately
- **Progress Feedback**: Users see voice processing progress in real-time
- **Team Coordination**: Multiple PMs know when claims are approved

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"At 4:58pm Friday, Conor uploads urgent voice message in Waterford. Sarah (validator in Dublin) instantly sees it in her queue, validates it by 5:01pm. Real-time update shows Conor the approval before he leaves site."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Friday evening deadlines require instant coordination
- Geographically distributed teams need instant updates
- Time-critical validation can't wait for page refreshes

**When Developers Mention It:** "Real-time connection is down, updates won't show"

---

## 🤖 AI & Processing

### 🟡 Replicate (Backup Processing)
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Backup AI service when OpenAI is down or expensive
- **Primary**: OpenAI Whisper (fastest, most accurate)
- **Backup**: Replicate (cheaper, different models available)
- **Automatic**: System switches based on cost/availability

**Why We Chose Backup AI Processing:**
- **Business Continuity**: OpenAI outages can't stop Friday deadline claims
- **Cost Management**: Use cheaper models for low-priority processing
- **Quality Options**: Different models for different content types

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Friday 3pm: OpenAI hits rate limits during nationwide construction claim rush. System automatically switches to Replicate for new voice messages. All PMs still meet 5pm deadline - they don't even know about the switch."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Friday deadline is non-negotiable for construction industry
- Seasonal peaks (end of financial year) overload primary AI services
- Different voice qualities need different processing approaches

**When Developers Mention It:** "OpenAI rate limited, switching to Replicate"

---

### 🟡 Webhooks
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Automatic notifications between systems
- **Example**: WhatsApp sends new message → Webhook → Your app processes it
- **Like**: Doorbell ringing when someone arrives
- **Direction**: External system calls your app (reverse of normal API calls)

**🚨 CONFUSION ALERT - Webhooks vs API Calls:**
- **API Calls**: You ask for data ("Hey WhatsApp, any new messages?")
- **Webhooks**: They tell you when something happens ("Hey, new message arrived!")
- **Think of it**: API = you checking mailbox, Webhook = doorbell when mail arrives

**Popular Examples You Might Know:**
- **GitHub Webhooks** - Notify when code is pushed
- **Stripe Webhooks** - Notify when payment is processed
- **Slack Webhooks** - Send messages to Slack channels
- **Zapier** - Connects different services via webhooks

**Why We Chose Webhooks for Integration:**
- **WhatsApp Instant Processing**: Message arrives, processing starts immediately
- **Payment Automation**: Stripe payment = instant account upgrade
- **Efficiency**: No constant polling = lower server costs

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Declan sends voice message via WhatsApp at 4:57pm Friday. Webhook triggers instant processing - by 4:59pm transcription is ready for review. Without webhooks, he'd wait until next scheduled check at 5:15pm (too late for deadline)."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Time-critical Friday deadlines require instant processing
- WhatsApp is primary communication tool for construction workers
- Efficient resource usage keeps costs low during growth phase

**When Developers Mention It:** "WhatsApp webhook is not receiving messages"

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Concepts

### 🟡 React Ecosystem Importance
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Why React is the right choice for your app

**Benefits:**
- **Talent Pool**: Most developers know React
- **Component Library**: Huge ecosystem of pre-built components
- **Mobile**: React Native allows same codebase for mobile app
- **Tooling**: Best development tools and testing frameworks

**Why We Chose React Ecosystem:**
- **Developer Pool**: 80% of Irish developers know React vs 30% Angular
- **Component Library**: Massive ecosystem for construction-specific UI needs
- **Mobile Strategy**: React Native = same codebase for iOS/Android app

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"You need to hire 2 more developers for Phase 2. React choice means 40+ qualified candidates vs 8 Angular candidates in Dublin. New developer contributes to codebase in week 1 instead of month 1."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Irish tech scene is React-heavy (major companies use it)
- Construction UI needs (maps, file uploads, forms) have React solutions
- Mobile app critical for field workers - React Native is proven path

---

### 🟡 T3 Stack
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Full-stack JavaScript alternative to your current setup
- **Frontend**: Next.js (same as you)
- **Backend**: tRPC instead of Django REST API
- **Database**: Prisma ORM instead of Django ORM
- **Auth**: NextAuth instead of Supabase Auth

**Popular Full-Stack Alternatives You Might Know:**
- **MEAN Stack** - MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js (older)
- **MERN Stack** - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (very popular)
- **LAMP Stack** - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (traditional web)
- **JAMstack** - JavaScript, APIs, Markup (modern static sites)
- **Ruby on Rails** - Full framework (GitHub, Shopify use this)
- **Laravel + Vue** - PHP equivalent (very popular)

**🚨 CONFUSION ALERT - Different "Stacks":**
- **Your Stack**: Next.js + Django + PostgreSQL (hybrid approach)
- **T3 Stack**: All JavaScript/TypeScript (single language)
- **Think of it**: Your stack = best tool for each job, T3 = one language for everything

**Why We Didn't Choose T3 Stack:**
- **AI Ecosystem**: Python has superior voice/ML libraries vs JavaScript
- **Validation UI**: Django Admin perfect for non-technical validators
- **Market Reality**: More Python+React developers than full-stack TS experts

**🏗️ Real Construction Scenario:**
*"Sarah (validator) isn't technical but needs to review 50 voice transcriptions daily. Django Admin gives her simple, powerful interface. T3/tRPC would require custom admin UI = 4 weeks extra development."*

**Perfect Fit Because:**
- Voice processing requires Python's mature AI ecosystem
- Non-technical validators need simple, proven admin interfaces
- Hybrid approach gets best of both worlds without complexity

---

## 🚀 Infrastructure & Scaling

### 🟢 Redis Clustering
**Progress:** ❌ | 🤔 | ✅ | 🎯

**Simple Explanation:** Multiple Redis servers working together
- **Problem**: Single Redis server becomes bottleneck at scale
- **Solution**: Spread data across multiple Redis instances
- **When Needed**: 1000+ concurrent users, heavy processing load

**Not Critical Now:** Your current Redis setup handles MVP scale fine

---

## 🔍 Common Confusion Clarifications

### 🤯 **"But They Sound the Same!"** - Key Differences

**State Management vs Server State Caching:**
- **Zustand (State)** = What the user is doing now (current tab, form data)
- **React Query (Server Cache)** = What the server told us (project lists, user data)
- **Memory trick**: State = temporary thoughts, Cache = saved knowledge

**Redis vs PostgreSQL:**
- **PostgreSQL** = Permanent records (birth certificates, contracts)
- **Redis** = Quick notes (sticky notes, recent calls)
- **Memory trick**: PostgreSQL = filing cabinet, Redis = desktop

**Real-time vs Webhooks:**
- **Real-time** = Broadcast to all users (stadium announcements)
- **Webhooks** = Private notification to your app (personal phone call)
- **Memory trick**: Real-time = TV broadcast, Webhooks = doorbell

**Django-Q vs Redis:**
- **Redis** = The job board (lists what needs to be done)
- **Django-Q** = The workers (people doing the jobs)
- **Memory trick**: Redis = restaurant orders, Django-Q = kitchen staff

**SSR vs SSG vs Client-Side:**
- **SSG** = Pre-made sandwich (fastest to serve)
- **SSR** = Made-to-order sandwich (fresh but takes time)
- **Client-Side** = DIY sandwich kit (user assembles it)

---

## 💬 Developer Conversation Cheat Sheet

**When developers say:** → **What they mean:** → **Your response should be:**

- "JWT expired" → User needs to log in again → "How often does this happen? Should we extend the timeout?"
- "Redis is down" → App will be slower, background processing stopped → "What's the backup plan? How long to fix?"
- "Real-time connection lost" → Users won't see live updates → "Do users need to refresh? How do they know?"
- "Django-Q worker crashed" → Voice processing stopped → "Are voice messages queuing up? Do we lose any data?"
- "CDN cache needs clearing" → Deploy might take time to show globally → "How long until all users see the update?"
- "TypeScript errors" → Code safety checks preventing deployment → "Are these critical bugs or just type issues?"
- "Webhook endpoint down" → WhatsApp messages not being received → "Do we lose messages or just delay processing?"
- "Rate limited by OpenAI" → Need to slow down API calls or switch to backup → "Should we switch to Replicate automatically?"

**🚨 Confusion Alert Phrases to Ask About:**
- "State management issue" → Ask: "Is this Zustand state or server data caching?"
- "Caching problem" → Ask: "Is this Redis cache or React Query cache?"
- "Real-time not working" → Ask: "Is this push notifications or webhook receiving?"
- "Background job failed" → Ask: "Is this Django-Q worker or Redis storage?"
