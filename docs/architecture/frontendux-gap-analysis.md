# Frontend/UX Gap Analysis

## ðŸ”´ Critical Gaps Identified

Based on comparing the PRD's 16 stories against the current front-end spec (4-screen MVP flow), here are the missing UI/UX specifications:

### Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- **GAP**: User registration/onboarding flow (Story 1.2)
- **GAP**: Company type selection UI (subcontractor vs main contractor)
- **GAP**: Multi-tenant project selection interface (Story 1.3)

## ðŸ“Š Gap Remediation Strategy

I'll incorporate these gaps into the architecture with a phased approach:
1. **MVP (Screens 1-4)**: Already covered in front-end spec
2. **Phase 1 Extensions**: Auth, projects, basic validation queue
3. **Phase 2 Additions**: Analytics, search, bulk operations
4. **Phase 3 Enhancements**: API management, white-labeling, advanced analytics
