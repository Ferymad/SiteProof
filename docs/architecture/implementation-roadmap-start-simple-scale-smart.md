  - Metadata and project information
  - Direct PDF download functionality

🔲 **Deploy to staging environment**
🔲 **Test with construction PM using real data**
🔲 **Measure actual accuracy and time savings** (targeting >90% accuracy validation)
🔲 **User feedback collection** (Epic 1A graduation criteria: 3/3)
🔲 **Iterate based on real construction site usage**

## Phase 3: Post-Validation Improvements (Weeks 6-8)
🔲 Fix issues discovered in real testing
🔲 User registration/onboarding UI
🔲 Project management dashboard
🔲 Enhanced error handling based on real failures
🔲 Performance optimizations for actual load patterns

## Phase 4: Scale Based on Learning (Months 3-6)
