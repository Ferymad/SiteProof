# Summary

This fullstack architecture provides a comprehensive blueprint for building the Construction Evidence Machine, incorporating all identified frontend/UX gaps with a clear remediation roadmap. The architecture balances MVP speed with enterprise scalability, using modern technologies optimized for the construction industry's unique requirements.

Key architectural decisions:
- **Hybrid deployment** (Vercel + Railway + Supabase) for optimal cost/performance
- **API-first monolith** enabling rapid development with future microservices option
- **Mobile-first frontend** with progressive enhancement for desktop
- **Event-driven processing** with real-time updates for time-critical workflows
- **Smart confidence routing** for risk-based validation with Friday mode optimization
- **Input recovery patterns** preventing data loss during critical workflows
- **Start Simple, Scale Smart** approach avoiding over-engineering
