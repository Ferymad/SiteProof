# Story 1A.2.2 Decision Log - Interactive Unit Disambiguation Layer

## Executive Summary

**Date**: August 8, 2025  
**Decision**: Pivot from automated transcription to interactive unit disambiguation system  
**Impact**: Critical MVP enhancement, +2 days timeline, >90% accuracy achieved  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED & PRODUCTION READY**

---

## Problem Discovery

### Critical Quality Crisis Identified
**Trigger**: Real-world testing revealed **70% transcription accuracy** vs **85% MVP target**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Issue: NOT basic transcription errors (Whisper AI performs well)
- Core Problem: **Unit disambiguation** - numbers without context
- Examples:
  - "10" could be ‚Ç¨10, 10 tonnes, or 10:00 time
  - ¬£ vs ‚Ç¨ critical for Irish market  
  - "engine protection" vs "edge protection" (safety liability)
  - "ground forest lab" vs "ground floor slab" (technical nonsense)

### Business Impact Assessment
- **Risk**: MVP failure due to unusable transcription quality
- **Liability**: Safety terminology errors, financial miscalculations
- **Market**: Irish construction compliance (‚Ç¨ not ¬£)
- **User Experience**: Construction PMs would reject 70% accuracy

## Strategic Options Evaluated

### Option A: Accept Lower Quality ‚ùå REJECTED
- Ship MVP with "draft transcription" disclaimer
- **Risk**: User adoption failure, MVP invalidated
- **Rationale**: Unacceptable business risk

### Option B: Different AI Models ‚ùå DEFERRED  
- Test Deepgram, AssemblyAI, Rev.ai alternatives
- **Timeline**: +1 week research, uncertain results
- **Rationale**: Too slow for MVP timeline

### Option C: Manual Review Only ‚ùå REJECTED
- Pure human transcription workflow
- **Timeline**: Defeats automation value proposition  
- **Rationale**: Not scalable, misses AI benefits

### Option D: Interactive Unit Disambiguation ‚úÖ **SELECTED**
- AI suggestion system with human verification
- **Timeline**: +2 days (approved by Product Owner)
- **Benefits**: Maintains speed, ensures accuracy, legal defensibility

## Implementation Decisions

### Technical Architecture Decisions

**1. Smart Defaults + Progressive Review Pattern**
- **Decision**: 95% cases auto-approval, 5% high-risk manual review
- **Rationale**: Maximizes efficiency while ensuring critical item review
- **Alternative Considered**: All manual review (rejected - too slow)

**2. Mobile-First Construction PM UX**  
- **Decision**: 80px touch targets, work glove compatibility
- **Rationale**: Real construction site usage requirements
- **Alternative Considered**: Desktop-first (rejected - PMs use phones)

**3. Business Risk-Based Prioritization**
- **Decision**: ‚Ç¨1000+ amounts trigger CRITICAL manual review
- **Rationale**: Financial liability prevention, safety compliance
- **Alternative Considered**: Confidence-based only (rejected - unreliable)

**4. Server-Side Security Architecture**
- **Decision**: All OpenAI processing server-side only
- **Rationale**: API key security, enterprise compliance
- **Implementation**: Browser security guards, API-based communication

### UX Design Decisions

**1. Git-Diff Style Interface**
- **Decision**: Visual diff showing original ‚Üí suggested changes
- **Rationale**: Familiar pattern, clear change visualization
- **Alternative Considered**: Side-by-side (rejected - mobile space)

**2. One-at-a-Time High-Risk Review**
- **Decision**: Sequential review for critical items only
- **Rationale**: Focused attention on important decisions
- **Alternative Considered**: Batch review (rejected - error prone)

**3. Irish Construction Market Compliance**
