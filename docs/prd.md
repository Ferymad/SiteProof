# Construction Evidence Machine Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Status Update**: âœ… Epic 1A Complete (Stories 1.1-1.5) | ðŸš€ Epic 1B In Development (Stories 1.6-1.8: Unified Input & PDF Generation)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- **Primary**: Reduce PM routine documentation time from 15 hours/week to 2 hours/week through AI-assisted organization
- **Phase 1**: Convert daily site communications (progress reports, safety notes, incident logs) into structured documentation packages
- **Phase 2**: Expand to low-stakes variations and change orders after proving system reliability  
- **Phase 3**: Enable comprehensive evidence packages for high-value claims once trust is established
- **Business**: Achieve â‚¬35K monthly recurring revenue (100 customers) within 18 months to enable full-time focus
- **Validation**: Prove concept through own company deployment before external customer acquisition
- **Platform Evolution**: Start WhatsApp integration, evolve to dedicated mobile app for better control

### Background Context

Irish construction subcontractors face a â‚¬500M annual market inefficiency caused by fragmented site communication and manual evidence compilation. The Construction Evidence Machine addresses the gap between casual WhatsApp communication and formal BoQ documentation requirements. With 35-45% of variation claims currently rejected due to poor documentation, subcontractors lose â‚¬47,633 annually per company through rejected claims, wasted PM time, and delayed payments.

The solution leverages AI-powered voice transcription (Whisper API) and construction-specific natural language processing to automatically organize site communications into TII-SCD compliant evidence packages, with mandatory human validation at every decision point to ensure accuracy in this risk-averse industry.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
**"WhatsApp-Simple, Bank-Secure"**: The interface should feel as natural as sending a WhatsApp message but inspire the confidence level of online banking. Construction PMs are comfortable with WhatsApp but need professional-grade reliability for business documentation.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Copy-Paste Workflow**: Primary interaction mimics familiar WhatsApp message sharing
- **One-Click Processing**: Single button transforms chaotic messages into structured documentation  
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show simple interface initially, reveal complexity only when needed
- **Mobile-First Touch Targets**: Large buttons optimized for work gloves and outdoor conditions
- **Offline-Ready Interactions**: Cache uploads for later processing when connectivity is poor

### Core Screens and Views
- **Dashboard**: Current projects with processing status and recent activity
- **Message Input**: WhatsApp paste area with drag-drop for voice notes and photos
- **Processing Status**: Real-time progress indicator during AI transcription and analysis
- **Review & Validation**: Split-screen showing original vs processed content for approval
- **Evidence Package Viewer**: PDF preview with edit capabilities before final generation
- **Project Archive**: Searchable history organized by date and project with filtering
- **Settings**: User profile, notification preferences, and data export controls

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Construction sites require robust accessibility due to outdoor conditions, safety equipment, and diverse workforce backgrounds. WCAG AA compliance ensures usability with high-contrast displays, large touch targets, and screen reader compatibility.

**MVP Accessibility Focus:**
- 60px minimum touch targets for gloved hands
- High contrast mode for outdoor visibility (7:1 ratios)
- Simple gestures only (no double-tap or complex interactions)
- Clear confidence indicators for AI-processed content

### Branding
**Industrial Minimalism**: Clean, professional interface that won't intimidate traditional construction users. Color palette inspired by high-vis safety equipment (orange accents) with professional blues and grays. Avoid overly technical or "startup-y" aesthetics that might alienate conservative industry users.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
**Mobile-First Web Application** supporting:
- **Primary**: Smartphones (iPhone/Android) for on-site message capture
- **Secondary**: Tablets for office review and package generation  
- **Tertiary**: Desktop for detailed validation and administration
- **Future**: Native mobile app once user patterns are validated

### Design Validation Framework

**Key Assumptions Requiring Validation:**
1. **Familiar Patterns Over Innovation**: PMs prefer WhatsApp-like copy-paste workflows over drag-drop or advanced UI patterns
2. **Professional Over Trendy**: Conservative design aesthetic builds trust for high-value financial documentation
3. **Construction Site Accessibility**: Outdoor glare, work gloves, safety equipment drive enhanced accessibility requirements
4. **Web-First Adoption**: Reduces installation barriers in IT-restricted construction companies
5. **Trust Through Transparency**: Prominent confidence scores and â‚¬1000+ warnings critical for adoption
6. **Recovery Over Prevention**: Simple LocalStorage recovery more valuable than complex error prevention

**Critical Validation Areas:**
- **Screen Size Optimization**: Test evidence package review effectiveness across mobile (5.5-6.7"), tablet (9-11"), and desktop (13"+) displays
- **Outdoor Visibility**: Field test color contrast requirements exceeding WCAG AA (4.5:1) potentially to WCAG AAA (7:1) for direct sunlight readability
- **Glove-Friendly Interface**: Test touch target sizing beyond 44px mobile standard to 60-80px for thick work gloves
- **Offline Functionality Priorities**: Define essential offline capabilities for poor connectivity construction sites (message capture, voice recording, photo storage)

### Epic 1B Wireframe Validation Framework âœ… COMPLETED

**Validation Status**: Comprehensive wireframe validation plan completed for Stories 1.6-1.8 implementation readiness.

**Validation Session Framework:**

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

"Based on this Construction Evidence Machine PRD, please create a comprehensive UX design plan focusing on mobile-first interface design for construction site usage. Priority areas: validate the 'WhatsApp-Simple, Bank-Secure' design philosophy through user research with Irish construction PMs, design glove-friendly touch interfaces for outdoor conditions, and create detailed user journey maps for the evidence validation workflow. Ensure WCAG AA compliance with construction-specific accessibility requirements including high contrast for outdoor visibility and simplified navigation for users wearing safety equipment. Critical MVP focus: confidence scoring displays, â‚¬1000+ amount warnings, and browser crash recovery using LocalStorage."

### Architect Prompt

"Using this Construction Evidence Machine PRD as foundation, please design a scalable API-first architecture for the Django + Next.js + Supabase stack. Focus on: event-driven integration architecture supporting main contractor API access, vector search implementation for construction terminology similarity matching, human validation queue scalability for 1 validator per 20 customers, and real-time processing pipeline for AI transcription with confidence scoring. Include specific plans for WhatsApp Business API integration, TII-SCD compliance audit trails, and cost-effective scaling from â‚¬45/month MVP to â‚¬170/month at 1000 users. MVP essentials: implement LocalStorage for state preservation, confidence score tracking, and progressive enhancement architecture for future features."
