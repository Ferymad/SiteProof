### Existing Implementation Reference
**Archive Location**: `docs/stories/archive/pre-untangling-2025-08-11/clean-mvp-1a3/`

The clean MVP implementation already provides ~90% of this story's requirements:
- **<2 minute validation workflow** (exceeds <3 minute target)
- **Professional UX** with smooth transitions
- **Mobile-responsive design** with touch-friendly interactions
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- **Loading states** and progress management

### Complete Workflow Steps
1. **Input Step**: Unified input interface (Story 1.6)
2. **Processing Step**: AI transcription and smart features (Stories 1.4-1.5)
3. **Validation Step**: Human validation with approve/reject/edit (existing)
4. **Preview Step**: PDF preview with edit capabilities (Story 1.7)
5. **Generation Step**: PDF creation and download (Story 1.7)
6. **Completion Step**: Success confirmation with options for next actions

### Performance Requirements
- **End-to-End Timing**: <3 minutes total workflow completion
- **Step Timing Breakdown**:
  - Input to processing: <5 seconds
  - Processing (transcription): <30 seconds (existing)
  - Validation: <2 minutes (existing)
  - PDF generation: <5 seconds (Story 1.7)
  - Total: ~2.5 minutes (within target)

### Integration Points
- **Story 1.6**: Unified input interface integration
- **Story 1.7**: PDF generation workflow integration
- **Existing AI Pipeline**: Leverage production-ready transcription system
- **Existing Validation**: Leverage existing human validation workflow

### UI/UX Standards from Existing Implementation
- **Touch Targets**: 80px+ for mobile accessibility (existing standard)
- **Loading States**: Professional loading indicators with progress
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks with user-friendly messages
- **Mobile First**: Responsive design optimized for on-site use
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintain existing professional styling patterns

### Performance Optimization Strategy
- **Client-Side Optimization**:
  - Component lazy loading where appropriate
  - Optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
  - Efficient state management to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Server-Side Optimization**:
  - Leverage existing <30s transcription performance
  - Optimize PDF generation for <5s requirement
  - Database query optimization for workflow state management

### Error Recovery Scenarios
- **Transcription Failures**: Retry with different settings or manual fallback
- **Validation Issues**: Allow re-editing and re-processing
- **PDF Generation Failures**: Fallback to JSON export (Story 1.7)
- **Network Issues**: Offline capability and automatic retry mechanisms
- **Session Timeouts**: Automatic session recovery where possible

### Metrics and Monitoring
- **Workflow Timing**: Track each step and total completion time
- **Error Rates**: Monitor failure points and recovery success
- **User Behavior**: Track common paths and abandonment points
- **Performance**: Monitor UI responsiveness and loading times
- **Mobile Usage**: Track mobile vs desktop usage patterns

### Testing Requirements
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow from input to PDF download
- **Performance Tests**: Verify <3 minute total and <100ms UI transitions
- **Error Recovery Tests**: Test all error scenarios and recovery paths
- **Mobile Tests**: Complete workflow testing on actual mobile devices
- **Load Tests**: Verify performance under realistic usage conditions
