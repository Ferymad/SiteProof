### Architecture Reference
**Source**: `docs/architecture.md` - Data models, API specifications, and authentication architecture

### Database Schema (From Architecture)
```sql
-- Company table with multi-tenancy support
CREATE TABLE companies (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('subcontractor', 'main_contractor', 'validator')),
    subscription_tier VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'trial',
    settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Users table with company relationship
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'pm', 'validator', 'viewer')),
    company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Authentication Architecture
- **Primary Auth**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- **Session Management**: 15-minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
- **Storage**: httpOnly cookies for refresh tokens, memory for access tokens
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) for company data isolation

### Company Types and Permissions [Source: architecture.md#data-models]
**Company Types**:
- `subcontractor`: Standard construction subcontractor (default)
- `main_contractor`: Main contractor with additional validation features  
- `validator`: Third-party validation services

**User Roles**:
- `admin`: Full company management, user management, billing
- `pm`: Project management, evidence creation, team collaboration
- `validator`: Human validation tasks, quality assurance
- `viewer`: Read-only access to company data

### Frontend Architecture [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]
**Next.js App Router Structure**:
- `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Login page with AuthForm
- `app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` - Multi-step company registration
- `app/(auth)/layout.tsx` - Authentication layout wrapper
- `middleware.ts` - Route protection and session validation

**Components to Create**:
```typescript
// Authentication components [Source: architecture.md#component-architecture]
- AuthForm: Existing component needs company registration extension
- CompanyRegistrationFlow: Multi-step signup with progress indicators
- UserProfileForm: Profile management with construction industry fields
- CompanySettingsPanel: Company information and team management

// State Management [Source: architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
- useAppStore: Zustand store with user/company state
- AuthenticationService: Supabase auth integration service
```

### Backend Architecture [Source: architecture.md#backend-architecture]
**Django Apps Structure**:
```python
# apps/authentication/ - User and company management
- models.py: User and Company models with proper relationships
- views.py: Authentication and registration API endpoints
- serializers.py: DRF serializers for user/company data
- permissions.py: Role-based access control classes
- middleware.py: Company context injection middleware

# Integration with existing Django structure from Story 1.1
- apps/api/bmad_api/settings.py: Authentication configuration
- apps/api/processing_api/: API endpoints with auth middleware
```

### Multi-Tenant Security Implementation
- **RLS Policies**: Automatic company_id filtering on all queries
- **API Middleware**: Inject company context into request objects
- **Permission Classes**: Django REST Framework permission classes for roles
- **Data Isolation**: Ensure no cross-company data access possible

### Integration Points
- **Supabase Auth**: Primary authentication provider
- **API Authentication**: JWT tokens for API access
- **Frontend State**: Zustand store for authentication state
- **Middleware**: Next.js middleware for route protection

### Security Requirements
- **Password Policy**: Minimum 8 characters, complexity requirements
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/minute for authenticated users
- **Session Security**: Secure cookie settings, CSRF protection
- **Data Protection**: GDPR compliance, right to deletion
