### Architecture Reference
**Source**: `docs/architecture.md` - Data models, API specifications, and authentication architecture

### Database Schema (From Architecture)
```sql
-- Company table with multi-tenancy support
CREATE TABLE companies (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('subcontractor', 'main_contractor', 'validator')),
    subscription_tier VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'trial',
    settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Users table with company relationship
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'pm', 'validator', 'viewer')),
    company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Authentication Architecture
- **Primary Auth**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- **Session Management**: 15-minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
- **Storage**: httpOnly cookies for refresh tokens, memory for access tokens
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) for company data isolation

### Company Types and Permissions [Source: architecture.md#data-models]
**Company Types**:
- `subcontractor`: Standard construction subcontractor (default)
- `main_contractor`: Main contractor with additional validation features  
- `validator`: Third-party validation services

**User Roles**:
- `admin`: Full company management, user management, billing
- `pm`: Project management, evidence creation, team collaboration
- `validator`: Human validation tasks, quality assurance
- `viewer`: Read-only access to company data

### Frontend Architecture [Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]
**Next.js App Router Structure**:
- `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Login page with AuthForm
- `app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` - Multi-step company registration
- `app/(auth)/layout.tsx` - Authentication layout wrapper
- `middleware.ts` - Route protection and session validation

**Components to Create**:
```typescript
// Authentication components [Source: architecture.md#component-architecture]
- AuthForm: Existing component needs company registration extension
- CompanyRegistrationFlow: Multi-step signup with progress indicators
- UserProfileForm: Profile management with construction industry fields
- CompanySettingsPanel: Company information and team management

// State Management [Source: architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
- useAppStore: Zustand store with user/company state
- AuthenticationService: Supabase auth integration service
```

### Backend Architecture [Source: architecture.md#backend-architecture]
**Django Apps Structure**:
```python
# apps/authentication/ - User and company management
- models.py: User and Company models with proper relationships
- views.py: Authentication and registration API endpoints
- serializers.py: DRF serializers for user/company data

- middleware.py: Company context injection middleware

# Integration with existing Django structure from Story 1.1
- apps/api/bmad_api/settings.py: Authentication configuration
- apps/api/processing_api/: API endpoints with auth middleware
```

### Multi-Tenant Security Implementation
- **RLS Policies**: Automatic company_id filtering on all queries
- **API Middleware**: Inject company context into request objects
- **Permission Classes**: Django REST Framework permission classes for roles
- **Data Isolation**: Ensure no cross-company data access possible

### Integration Points
- **Supabase Auth**: Primary authentication provider
- **API Authentication**: JWT tokens for API access

### Deployment Notes - PostgreSQL Compatibility Fixes Applied

During Supabase deployment, the dev agent successfully resolved three PostgreSQL compatibility issues:

1. **Generated Columns**: Replaced with standard columns + indexes for immutability requirements
2. **Functional Indexes**: Simplified to avoid PostgreSQL casting syntax restrictions  
3. **PL/pgSQL Syntax**: Fixed GET DIAGNOSTICS arithmetic with proper variable handling

**Result**: All tables, functions, and RLS policies deployed successfully. System is production-operational.

## Security Testing Guide

### Multi-Tenant Security Validation Procedures
**Task 5 Security Implementation Testing**

This comprehensive testing guide validates the multi-tenant security implementation.

#### Prerequisites

**Environment Setup**:
- Supabase project configured with proper environment variables
- Database migrations applied (especially `004_complete_multi_tenant_security.sql`)
- Two test companies created with different users

**Test User Setup**:
```sql
-- Create test companies
INSERT INTO companies (name, type) VALUES 
('Test Company A', 'subcontractor'),
('Test Company B', 'main_contractor');

-- Create test users (use Supabase Auth UI or API)
-- Company A: admin-a@test.com, user-a@test.com
-- Company B: admin-b@test.com, user-b@test.com
```

#### Test Categories

**1. Row Level Security (RLS) Validation**

*1.1 Company Data Isolation*
Test: Users can only access their own company data
```sql
-- Login as Company A user, run:
SELECT * FROM companies;
-- Should only return Company A

SELECT * FROM users;
-- Should only return users from Company A
```
Expected Result: ✅ Only company-specific data visible

*1.2 WhatsApp Submissions Isolation*
Test: Users can only see submissions from their company
1. Create submissions for both companies
2. Login as Company A user
3. Query submissions: `SELECT * FROM whatsapp_submissions`
Expected Result: ✅ Only Company A submissions visible

*1.3 Processing Analytics Isolation*
Test: Analytics data is company-isolated
```sql
-- As Company A user:
SELECT * FROM processing_analytics;
-- Should only show Company A analytics
```
Expected Result: ✅ Only company-specific analytics visible

**2. API Security Middleware Testing**

*2.1 Authentication Required*
Test: All protected endpoints require valid authentication
```bash
# Test without authentication
curl -X GET /api/company/users
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# Test with invalid token  
curl -X GET /api/company/users -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token"
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized
```
Expected Result: ✅ Proper 401 responses for unauthenticated requests

*2.2 Company Context Injection*
Test: API middleware properly injects company context
1. Login as Company A admin
2. Call `/api/company/users`
3. Verify only Company A users are returned
Expected Result: ✅ API responses filtered by company context

*2.3 Cross-Company Access Prevention*
Test: Users cannot access other companies' data via API
1. Login as Company A user
2. Try to update a Company B user's role
3. Should fail with permission error
Expected Result: ✅ Cross-company operations blocked

**3. Security Breach Detection**

*3.1 Cross-Company Access Detection*
Test: System detects attempts to access other companies' data
1. Simulate cross-company access
2. Run security analysis: `POST /api/security/monitor`
3. Check for CROSS_COMPANY_ACCESS alerts
Expected Result: ✅ Security alerts generated for violations

*3.2 Brute Force Detection*
Test: System detects authentication attack patterns
1. Generate >20 failed login attempts from same IP
2. Run security analysis
3. Check for BRUTE_FORCE_ATTACK alerts
Expected Result: ✅ Brute force attacks detected

**4. Permission System Validation**

*4.1 Role-Based Access Control*
Test: Each role has appropriate permissions

| Role | Can Manage Users | Can View Reports | Can Access Validation |
|------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| pm | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| validator | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| viewer | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

Expected Result: ✅ Role permissions enforced correctly

**Security Penetration Testing**

*SQL Injection Resistance*
Test: API endpoints resistant to SQL injection
```bash
curl -X POST /api/company/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "1; DROP TABLE users; --", "new_role": "admin"}'
```
Expected Result: ✅ No SQL injection vulnerability

*JWT Token Validation*
Test: System validates JWT tokens properly
1. Modify JWT token payload (change company_id)
2. Use modified token for API requests
3. Verify requests are rejected
Expected Result: ✅ JWT manipulation detected and blocked
