    "changes": [{
      "value": {
        "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
        "messages": [{
          "id": "MESSAGE_ID",
          "from": "PHONE_NUMBER",
          "timestamp": "TIMESTAMP",
          "type": "text|audio|image|document",
          "text": {"body": "MESSAGE_TEXT"},
          "audio": {"id": "MEDIA_ID"},
          "image": {"id": "MEDIA_ID"},
          "document": {"id": "MEDIA_ID"}
        }]
      }
    }]
  }]
}
```

### File Upload Configuration

- **Input Validation**: Sanitize WhatsApp message content and metadata
- **Storage Security**: Secure file access with proper permissions

### Smart Enhancement Guidance
**Integration Complexity**: HIGH
**Integration Types**: authentication, database, fileStorage

#### Integration Validation Checkpoints
- [ ] Verify Supabase client connection works with authentication
- [ ] Test project creation with company context from Auth system
- [ ] Validate file upload to organized storage buckets
- [ ] Confirm WhatsApp message parsing and database storage
- [ ] Test data flow between authentication, project creation, and message storage
- [ ] Verify error handling works correctly for all service failures

#### Phased Implementation Approach
**Phase 1**: Set up and verify Supabase connections (auth, database, storage)
**Phase 2**: Test basic operations (project CRUD, file upload, message parsing)
**Phase 3**: Build complete feature with comprehensive error handling

#### Authentication Integration Completeness
- [ ] Project creation respects company-based user sessions
- [ ] Protected routes prevent unauthorized project access
- [ ] User context properly passed to all components
- [ ] Session persistence works across browser refresh

### Performance Requirements
- **File Upload**: Progress indicators, chunked upload for large files
- **Message Processing**: Efficient parsing of large WhatsApp exports
- **Mobile Performance**: <3 second load time on 3G connections
- **Database Queries**: Indexed searches, pagination for large datasets

### Related Stories
- **Story 1.1**: Project Setup & Development Environment (provides: Next.js foundation, Supabase configuration, TypeScript setup)
- **Story 1.2**: User Authentication & Company Management (provides: company-based user sessions, role-based access patterns, user context retrieval methods)
- **Story 1.4**: Health Check & Basic AI Processing Pipeline (consumes: WhatsApp message data, project context for AI analysis)

### 🎯 Critical Implementation Patterns (For Dev Agent)
*Maximize One-Shot Success | Prevents common failure modes*

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEV AGENT**: Before implementing external service integration, fetch current patterns using REF-MCP queries below:

#### 1. SSR Client Initialization (SUPABASE)
**Why Critical**: Infinite auth loops from deprecated auth-helpers
**REF-MCP Query**: `Supabase SSR client initialization createClient @supabase/ssr middleware`
**Implementation Context**: initialization

#### 2. Middleware Setup (SUPABASE)
**Why Critical**: Circular dependency errors in Next.js middleware
**REF-MCP Query**: `Supabase middleware Next.js authentication updateSession`
**Implementation Context**: middleware

**DEV AGENT WORKFLOW**:
1. Use mcp__ref-tools__ref_search_documentation with each query above
2. Extract current code patterns from official documentation
3. Implement using fetched patterns to prevent failure modes
4. Validate implementation matches current best practices

*Role Separation: SM identifies patterns needed, Dev fetches and implements*

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA Architect)

### RIGOROUS QA TESTING RESULTS

**Overall Assessment: NOT PRODUCTION READY** - While the foundational implementation shows promise, systematic testing has uncovered **multiple critical issues** that prevent production deployment. The code requires significant additional development to address security vulnerabilities and complete missing functionality.

**✅ What Works Well:**
- **Project Creation**: Form validation and API endpoints functional
- **Project Listing**: Data retrieval and display working correctly
- **Search & Filtering**: Client-side functionality operational
- **Authentication Core**: Token-based auth working for basic operations
- **Mobile Responsive**: UI properly adapts to different screen sizes
- **Database Schema**: Core tables and relationships properly structured

#### 1. INCOMPLETE CRUD FUNCTIONALITY
**❌ SEVERITY: HIGH** - Missing essential project management features
- **Missing Edit/Delete UI**: No visible controls for updating or removing projects
- **API Authentication Failures**: PATCH/DELETE endpoints return 401 Unauthorized
- **User Experience Gap**: Users can create projects but cannot manage them afterward

**Files Affected:** `pages/projects.tsx`, `pages/api/projects/[id].ts`

#### 2. SECURITY VULNERABILITIES  
**❌ SEVERITY: CRITICAL** - Production-blocking security issues
- **SQL Injection Stored**: Malicious input `'; DROP TABLE projects; --` accepted and persisted
- **XSS Vulnerability**: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` stored in database without sanitization
- **No Server-Side Input Validation**: Backend accepts dangerous payloads without filtering

**Evidence:** Created project with name `'; DROP TABLE projects; --` and location `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` - **both stored successfully**

**Files Affected:** `pages/api/projects/index.ts`, input sanitization missing across all forms

#### 3. WHATSAPP INTEGRATION FAILURE
**❌ SEVERITY: CRITICAL** - Core functionality completely broken
- **RLS Violation Error**: `new row violates row-level security policy` (Code: 42501)
- **403 Forbidden**: All WhatsApp form submissions blocked by database policies
- **Primary Workflow Broken**: Users cannot submit WhatsApp data for processing

**Error Details:** Browser shows "Failed to submit data" - complete failure of AC2 & AC3

**Files Affected:** WhatsApp submission endpoints, RLS policies, project-message relationships

### BUGS FIXED DURING TESTING

#### Backend Code Issues Resolved:
- **Fixed**: Removed lingering `createServerSupabaseClient()` references in `pages/api/projects/[id].ts`
- **Fixed**: Updated authentication token extraction to handle Supabase cookie format properly
- **Fixed**: Compilation errors preventing PATCH/DELETE operations

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA STATUS

❌ **AC1 (Project Creation)**: ✅ **PARTIAL** - Creation works, Edit/Delete missing  
❌ **AC2 (WhatsApp Input)**: ❌ **FAILED** - Form submission completely blocked by RLS  
❌ **AC3 (Message Storage)**: ❌ **FAILED** - No messages can be stored due to RLS violations  
✅ **AC4 (File Handling)**: ⚠️ **UNTESTED** - Cannot test due to submission failures  
✅ **AC5 (Mobile-Optimized)**: ✅ **PASSED** - Responsive design working correctly  
❌ **AC6 (Integration Ready)**: ❌ **FAILED** - Database policies prevent webhook integration  

### REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT FIXES

**PRIORITY 1 - CRITICAL (Production Blocking):**
1. **Fix WhatsApp RLS Policies**: Update database security policies to allow message submissions
2. **Implement Input Sanitization**: Add server-side validation to prevent SQL injection/XSS
3. **Complete Project CRUD**: Add Edit/Delete UI components and fix API authentication

**PRIORITY 2 - HIGH (Feature Completion):**
4. **Fix PATCH/DELETE APIs**: Resolve authentication issues for project updates
5. **Add Edit/Delete UI**: Implement missing project management interface
6. **Comprehensive Security Review**: Audit all input points for vulnerabilities

**PRIORITY 3 - MEDIUM (Polish):**
7. **Error Handling Enhancement**: Improve user feedback for failed operations  
8. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing of complete workflows
9. **Performance Optimization**: Address any identified bottlenecks

### TESTING METHODOLOGY USED

**Systematic Approach Applied:**
1. ✅ Database schema validation and API response structure verification
2. ✅ Form validation edge cases (empty inputs, malicious payloads, invalid dates)  
3. ✅ Search and filtering functionality testing
4. ✅ Mobile responsiveness verification (375px viewport)
5. ✅ End-to-end WhatsApp form submission testing
6. ❌ Security penetration testing (FAILED - vulnerabilities found)
7. ❌ CRUD operations completeness testing (FAILED - missing functionality)

### FINAL QA VERDICT

**❌ NOT APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**

**Recommendation**: **RETURN TO DEVELOPMENT** - This story requires significant additional work before it can be considered complete. While the foundation is solid, the critical security vulnerabilities and broken core functionality prevent production deployment.

**Development Priority**: Address security issues first (input sanitization), then fix WhatsApp submission RLS policies, then complete missing CRUD functionality.

**Re-Test Required**: Full regression testing needed after fixes, particularly focusing on security validation and end-to-end WhatsApp workflows.

## 🔍 COMPREHENSIVE QA RE-TESTING RESULTS (2025-08-12)

### Review Date: 2025-08-12
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA Architect)
### Testing Scope: ULTRA-RIGOROUS Security & Functionality Re-Validation

**Overall Assessment: MAJOR CONCERNS IDENTIFIED** - While previous security fixes show good progress, systematic re-testing reveals **critical architectural issues** that prevent production deployment.

---

### ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### 1. **API ENDPOINT AUTHENTICATION FAILURES**
**❌ SEVERITY: CRITICAL** - Production-blocking authentication system failures
- **Issue**: `pages/api/projects/[id].ts:118` references undefined `userContext.company_id`
- **Evidence**: Lines 118 & 172 use `userContext` variable that doesn't exist in scope
- **Impact**: All PATCH/DELETE operations will throw runtime errors
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent authentication pattern between `/index.ts` and `/[id].ts`

**Files Affected:** `pages/api/projects/[id].ts:118, 172`

#### 2. **SERVER STABILITY ISSUES**
**❌ SEVERITY: HIGH** - Application frequently unresponsive
- **Issue**: Development server hangs and becomes unresponsive during testing

- **Impact**: Cannot complete end-to-end testing, suggests memory leaks or blocking operations
- **Root Cause**: Potential infinite loops or unhandled async operations

#### 3. **INCOMPLETE INPUT VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION**
**❌ SEVERITY: MEDIUM** - Security fixes not consistently applied
- **Issue**: `pages/api/projects/[id].ts` lacks validation library imports
- **Missing**: Input sanitization for project updates (only creation is protected)
- **Risk**: SQL injection/XSS still possible through PATCH endpoints
- **Gap**: Validation inconsistency across API endpoints

**Files Affected:** `pages/api/projects/[id].ts` - missing validation imports

---

### 🔍 DETAILED CODE REVIEW FINDINGS

#### **Authentication System Inconsistencies**

**BROKEN CODE PATTERN** in `pages/api/projects/[id].ts`:

.eq('company_id', userContext.company_id)  // ❌ userContext doesn't exist
```

**CORRECT PATTERN** should match `pages/api/projects/index.ts`:
```typescript
// Should use requirePermission like index.ts does
const userContext = await requirePermission(token, 'MANAGE_PROJECTS')
```

#### **Security Validation Results**

**✅ Input Sanitization (Partial)**: 
- `lib/validation.ts` properly implements XSS/SQL injection prevention

  - **Steps Executed**: Created "QA Test Project 2025" with valid data
  - **Result**: Project created successfully, appears in list
  - **Issues Found**: None

- **Project Edit Functionality**: ✗ FAIL
  - **Steps Executed**: Clicked Edit button on project
  - **Result**: JavaScript error "Cannot access 'project' before initialization"
  - **Evidence**: Variable shadowing bug in ProjectCreateForm.tsx:56 and :84
  - **Fix Applied**: Changed variable name from `project` to `updatedProject` to avoid shadowing
  - **Status After Fix**: ✓ RESOLVED

- **Project List & Display**: ⚠️ SECURITY CONCERN
  - **Steps Executed**: Viewed project list
  - **Result**: Malicious project names/locations from previous tests still displayed as raw text
  - **Evidence**: `'; DROP TABLE projects; --` and `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` visible in UI
  - **Issues Found**: While new input is validated, old malicious data needs cleanup

#### WhatsApp Submission Integration
- **RLS Policy Validation**: ✗ FAIL - CRITICAL
  - **Steps Executed**: 
    1. Selected project "QA Test Project 2025"
    2. Added WhatsApp messages with malicious content
    3. Clicked Submit
  - **Result**: Error 403 - "new row violates row-level security policy" (Code: 42501)
  - **Evidence**: Screenshot captured: story-1.3-rls-error.png
  - **Issues Found**: RLS policies still blocking legitimate WhatsApp submissions
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Core functionality broken

#### Story 1.2 Prevention Validation
- **No Infinite Auth Loops**: ✓ CONFIRMED - Navigation works correctly
- **Deprecated Package Detection**: ✓ CLEAN - Using @supabase/ssr correctly

### Critical Bugs Discovered

1. **Bug**: RLS Policy Violation on WhatsApp Submission
   - **Reproduction Steps**: 
     1. Navigate to Projects page
     2. Select any project and click "Add WhatsApp Data"
     3. Select project from dropdown
     4. Enter any WhatsApp messages
     5. Click "Submit Construction Data"
   - **Expected**: Data should be saved to database
   - **Actual**: Error 403 with RLS policy violation
   - **Evidence**: Screenshot: story-1.3-rls-error.png
   - **Fix Required**: Review and update RLS policies in migration 009_fix_whatsapp_submission_rls.sql
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL

2. **Bug**: Legacy Malicious Data Display
   - **Reproduction Steps**: 
     1. View Projects list
     2. Observe project names and locations
   - **Expected**: All displayed data should be sanitized
   - **Actual**: Raw malicious strings displayed in UI
   - **Fix Required**: Data migration to sanitize existing records OR display-time sanitization
   - **Priority**: HIGH

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: components/ProjectCreateForm.tsx
  - **Change**: Renamed variable from `project` to `updatedProject` on line 84
  - **Why**: Variable shadowing caused "Cannot access before initialization" error
  - **How**: Eliminates naming conflict between prop and local variable

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Generally good TypeScript patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly organized
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ Test coverage exists but needs expansion
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC2 and AC3 failing due to RLS issues
- **Brutal QA Requirements**: ✓ All critical scenarios tested

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed variable shadowing bug in ProjectCreateForm.tsx
- [x] Verified input validation working for new data
- [ ] Fix RLS policies for WhatsApp submissions (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Implement display-time sanitization for legacy data
- [ ] Add comprehensive API endpoint tests
- [ ] Implement data migration to clean existing malicious records

### Security Review

**Positive Findings:**
- ✓ Input validation properly prevents new SQL injection attempts
- ✓ XSS prevention working for new submissions
- ✓ Server-side validation implemented in API endpoints

**Remaining Concerns:**
- ✗ Legacy malicious data still present in database
- ✗ Display layer not sanitizing output
- ⚠️ Consider adding Content Security Policy headers

### Performance Considerations

- Page load times acceptable (~2 seconds)
- No significant performance issues detected
- Consider implementing pagination for large project lists

### Final Status

**✗ Changes Required - CRITICAL RLS FIX NEEDED**

**Brutal QA Summary**: Total scenarios tested: 8 | Passed: 5 | Failed: 3

**Recommendation**: While security improvements are substantial, the RLS policy violation completely breaks the core WhatsApp submission feature. This MUST be fixed before production. The legacy data display issue is also a security concern that should be addressed.

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix RLS policies immediately to allow WhatsApp submissions
2. Implement display-time sanitization or data migration
3. Re-test WhatsApp submission flow end-to-end
4. Consider adding automated tests for these scenarios
