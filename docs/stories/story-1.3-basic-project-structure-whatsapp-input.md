    "changes": [{
      "value": {
        "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
        "messages": [{
          "id": "MESSAGE_ID",
          "from": "PHONE_NUMBER",
          "timestamp": "TIMESTAMP",
          "type": "text|audio|image|document",
          "text": {"body": "MESSAGE_TEXT"},
          "audio": {"id": "MEDIA_ID"},
          "image": {"id": "MEDIA_ID"},
          "document": {"id": "MEDIA_ID"}
        }]
      }
    }]
  }]
}
```

### File Upload Configuration

- **Performance**: Lazy loading, image optimization, minimal bundle size

### Testing Execution Strategy
**Phase 1 - Unit Tests**: Project CRUD operations, WhatsApp message parsing logic, file validation functions
**Phase 2 - Integration Tests**: Supabase database connections, file upload to storage, API endpoint responses
**Phase 3 - Mobile Tests**: Touch interactions on 375px+ screens, responsive breakpoints, offline connectivity handling
**Phase 4 - E2E Tests**: Complete workflow from project creation through message storage

**Success Criteria Validation Order**:
1. Project creation form functional with all required fields
2. WhatsApp input accepts and parses messages correctly
3. File uploads work with proper size/type validation
4. Mobile UI responsive and touch-friendly on smartphones
5. All data properly stored with correct project relationships
6. Integration webhooks ready for WhatsApp Business API

### Security Considerations
- **File Upload Security**: Type validation, size limits, virus scanning
- **Data Isolation**: Ensure projects only accessible to company members
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize WhatsApp message content and metadata
- **Storage Security**: Secure file access with proper permissions

### Smart Enhancement Guidance
**Integration Complexity**: HIGH
**Integration Types**: authentication, database, fileStorage

#### Integration Validation Checkpoints
- [ ] Verify Supabase client connection works with authentication
- [ ] Test project creation with company context from Auth system
- [ ] Validate file upload to organized storage buckets
- [ ] Confirm WhatsApp message parsing and database storage
- [ ] Test data flow between authentication, project creation, and message storage
- [ ] Verify error handling works correctly for all service failures

#### Phased Implementation Approach
**Phase 1**: Set up and verify Supabase connections (auth, database, storage)
**Phase 2**: Test basic operations (project CRUD, file upload, message parsing)
**Phase 3**: Build complete feature with comprehensive error handling

#### Authentication Integration Completeness
- [ ] Project creation respects company-based user sessions
- [ ] Protected routes prevent unauthorized project access
- [ ] User context properly passed to all components
- [ ] Session persistence works across browser refresh

### Performance Requirements
- **File Upload**: Progress indicators, chunked upload for large files
- **Message Processing**: Efficient parsing of large WhatsApp exports
- **Mobile Performance**: <3 second load time on 3G connections
- **Database Queries**: Indexed searches, pagination for large datasets

### Related Stories
- **Story 1.1**: Project Setup & Development Environment (provides: Next.js foundation, Supabase configuration, TypeScript setup)
- **Story 1.2**: User Authentication & Company Management (provides: company-based user sessions, role-based access patterns, user context retrieval methods)
- **Story 1.4**: Health Check & Basic AI Processing Pipeline (consumes: WhatsApp message data, project context for AI analysis)

### 🎯 Critical Implementation Patterns (For Dev Agent)
*Maximize One-Shot Success | Prevents common failure modes*

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEV AGENT**: Before implementing external service integration, fetch current patterns using REF-MCP queries below:

#### 1. SSR Client Initialization (SUPABASE)
**Why Critical**: Infinite auth loops from deprecated auth-helpers
**REF-MCP Query**: `Supabase SSR client initialization createClient @supabase/ssr middleware`
**Implementation Context**: initialization

#### 2. Middleware Setup (SUPABASE)
**Why Critical**: Circular dependency errors in Next.js middleware
**REF-MCP Query**: `Supabase middleware Next.js authentication updateSession`
**Implementation Context**: middleware

**DEV AGENT WORKFLOW**:
1. Use mcp__ref-tools__ref_search_documentation with each query above
2. Extract current code patterns from official documentation
3. Implement using fetched patterns to prevent failure modes
4. Validate implementation matches current best practices

*Role Separation: SM identifies patterns needed, Dev fetches and implements*

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA Architect)

### RIGOROUS QA TESTING RESULTS

**Overall Assessment: NOT PRODUCTION READY** - While the foundational implementation shows promise, systematic testing has uncovered **multiple critical issues** that prevent production deployment. The code requires significant additional development to address security vulnerabilities and complete missing functionality.

**✅ What Works Well:**
- **Project Creation**: Form validation and API endpoints functional
- **Project Listing**: Data retrieval and display working correctly
- **Search & Filtering**: Client-side functionality operational
- **Authentication Core**: Token-based auth working for basic operations
- **Mobile Responsive**: UI properly adapts to different screen sizes
- **Database Schema**: Core tables and relationships properly structured

#### 1. INCOMPLETE CRUD FUNCTIONALITY
**❌ SEVERITY: HIGH** - Missing essential project management features
- **Missing Edit/Delete UI**: No visible controls for updating or removing projects
- **API Authentication Failures**: PATCH/DELETE endpoints return 401 Unauthorized
- **User Experience Gap**: Users can create projects but cannot manage them afterward

**Files Affected:** `pages/projects.tsx`, `pages/api/projects/[id].ts`

#### 2. SECURITY VULNERABILITIES  
**❌ SEVERITY: CRITICAL** - Production-blocking security issues
- **SQL Injection Stored**: Malicious input `'; DROP TABLE projects; --` accepted and persisted
- **XSS Vulnerability**: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` stored in database without sanitization
- **No Server-Side Input Validation**: Backend accepts dangerous payloads without filtering

**Evidence:** Created project with name `'; DROP TABLE projects; --` and location `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` - **both stored successfully**

**Files Affected:** `pages/api/projects/index.ts`, input sanitization missing across all forms

#### 3. WHATSAPP INTEGRATION FAILURE
**❌ SEVERITY: CRITICAL** - Core functionality completely broken
- **RLS Violation Error**: `new row violates row-level security policy` (Code: 42501)
- **403 Forbidden**: All WhatsApp form submissions blocked by database policies
- **Primary Workflow Broken**: Users cannot submit WhatsApp data for processing

**Error Details:** Browser shows "Failed to submit data" - complete failure of AC2 & AC3

**Files Affected:** WhatsApp submission endpoints, RLS policies, project-message relationships

### BUGS FIXED DURING TESTING

#### Backend Code Issues Resolved:
- **Fixed**: Removed lingering `createServerSupabaseClient()` references in `pages/api/projects/[id].ts`
- **Fixed**: Updated authentication token extraction to handle Supabase cookie format properly
- **Fixed**: Compilation errors preventing PATCH/DELETE operations

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA STATUS

❌ **AC1 (Project Creation)**: ✅ **PARTIAL** - Creation works, Edit/Delete missing  
❌ **AC2 (WhatsApp Input)**: ❌ **FAILED** - Form submission completely blocked by RLS  
❌ **AC3 (Message Storage)**: ❌ **FAILED** - No messages can be stored due to RLS violations  
✅ **AC4 (File Handling)**: ⚠️ **UNTESTED** - Cannot test due to submission failures  
✅ **AC5 (Mobile-Optimized)**: ✅ **PASSED** - Responsive design working correctly  
❌ **AC6 (Integration Ready)**: ❌ **FAILED** - Database policies prevent webhook integration  

### REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT FIXES

**PRIORITY 1 - CRITICAL (Production Blocking):**
1. **Fix WhatsApp RLS Policies**: Update database security policies to allow message submissions
2. **Implement Input Sanitization**: Add server-side validation to prevent SQL injection/XSS
3. **Complete Project CRUD**: Add Edit/Delete UI components and fix API authentication

**PRIORITY 2 - HIGH (Feature Completion):**
4. **Fix PATCH/DELETE APIs**: Resolve authentication issues for project updates
5. **Add Edit/Delete UI**: Implement missing project management interface
6. **Comprehensive Security Review**: Audit all input points for vulnerabilities

**PRIORITY 3 - MEDIUM (Polish):**
7. **Error Handling Enhancement**: Improve user feedback for failed operations  
8. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing of complete workflows
9. **Performance Optimization**: Address any identified bottlenecks

### TESTING METHODOLOGY USED

**Systematic Approach Applied:**
1. ✅ Database schema validation and API response structure verification
2. ✅ Form validation edge cases (empty inputs, malicious payloads, invalid dates)  
3. ✅ Search and filtering functionality testing
4. ✅ Mobile responsiveness verification (375px viewport)
5. ✅ End-to-end WhatsApp form submission testing
6. ❌ Security penetration testing (FAILED - vulnerabilities found)
7. ❌ CRUD operations completeness testing (FAILED - missing functionality)

### FINAL QA VERDICT

**❌ NOT APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**

**Recommendation**: **RETURN TO DEVELOPMENT** - This story requires significant additional work before it can be considered complete. While the foundation is solid, the critical security vulnerabilities and broken core functionality prevent production deployment.

**Development Priority**: Address security issues first (input sanitization), then fix WhatsApp submission RLS policies, then complete missing CRUD functionality.

**Re-Test Required**: Full regression testing needed after fixes, particularly focusing on security validation and end-to-end WhatsApp workflows.

## 🔍 COMPREHENSIVE QA RE-TESTING RESULTS (2025-08-12)

### Review Date: 2025-08-12
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA Architect)
### Testing Scope: ULTRA-RIGOROUS Security & Functionality Re-Validation

**Overall Assessment: MAJOR CONCERNS IDENTIFIED** - While previous security fixes show good progress, systematic re-testing reveals **critical architectural issues** that prevent production deployment.

---

### ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

#### 1. **API ENDPOINT AUTHENTICATION FAILURES**
**❌ SEVERITY: CRITICAL** - Production-blocking authentication system failures
- **Issue**: `pages/api/projects/[id].ts:118` references undefined `userContext.company_id`
- **Evidence**: Lines 118 & 172 use `userContext` variable that doesn't exist in scope
- **Impact**: All PATCH/DELETE operations will throw runtime errors
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent authentication pattern between `/index.ts` and `/[id].ts`

**Files Affected:** `pages/api/projects/[id].ts:118, 172`

#### 2. **SERVER STABILITY ISSUES**
**❌ SEVERITY: HIGH** - Application frequently unresponsive
- **Issue**: Development server hangs and becomes unresponsive during testing
- **Evidence**: Curl requests timeout after 28+ seconds, browser navigation fails
- **Impact**: Cannot complete end-to-end testing, suggests memory leaks or blocking operations
- **Root Cause**: Potential infinite loops or unhandled async operations

#### 3. **INCOMPLETE INPUT VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION**
**❌ SEVERITY: MEDIUM** - Security fixes not consistently applied
- **Issue**: `pages/api/projects/[id].ts` lacks validation library imports
- **Missing**: Input sanitization for project updates (only creation is protected)
- **Risk**: SQL injection/XSS still possible through PATCH endpoints
- **Gap**: Validation inconsistency across API endpoints

**Files Affected:** `pages/api/projects/[id].ts` - missing validation imports

---

### 🔍 DETAILED CODE REVIEW FINDINGS

#### **Authentication System Inconsistencies**

**BROKEN CODE PATTERN** in `pages/api/projects/[id].ts`:
```typescript
// Line 118 & 172 - UNDEFINED VARIABLE ERROR
.eq('company_id', userContext.company_id)  // ❌ userContext doesn't exist
```

**CORRECT PATTERN** should match `pages/api/projects/index.ts`:
```typescript
// Should use requirePermission like index.ts does
const userContext = await requirePermission(token, 'MANAGE_PROJECTS')
```

#### **Security Validation Results**

**✅ Input Sanitization (Partial)**: 
- `lib/validation.ts` properly implements XSS/SQL injection prevention
- Applied correctly in project creation API
- **Missing** in project update API

**✅ Database Security (Fixed)**: 
- RLS policies properly updated in migration `009_fix_whatsapp_submission_rls.sql`
- WhatsApp submission permissions now validate project access

**❌ API Consistency (Failed)**:
- Authentication patterns differ between endpoints
- Validation not uniformly applied across all operations

---

### 📊 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA RE-VALIDATION

❌ **AC1 (Project Creation)**: ❌ **FAILED** - Edit/Delete operations broken due to API errors  
⚠️ **AC2 (WhatsApp Input)**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Form exists but server stability issues prevent testing  
⚠️ **AC3 (Message Storage)**: ⚠️ **UNTESTABLE** - Cannot validate due to server responsiveness issues  
❌ **AC4 (File Handling)**: ❌ **UNTESTABLE** - Server instability blocks file upload testing  
✅ **AC5 (Mobile-Optimized)**: ✅ **PASSED** - Component code shows proper responsive patterns  
❌ **AC6 (Integration Ready)**: ❌ **BLOCKED** - API reliability issues prevent webhook readiness  

---

### 🚨 PRODUCTION BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED

1. **Fix API Authentication**: Correct undefined `userContext` references in `[id].ts`
2. **Resolve Server Stability**: Investigate and fix server hang/timeout issues
3. **Complete Input Validation**: Apply security validation to all PATCH/DELETE endpoints
4. **API Testing**: Implement automated API endpoint testing to prevent regression

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
5. **Error Handling Enhancement**: Improve error responses for debugging
6. **Performance Optimization**: Address server responsiveness bottlenecks
7. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation once stability is restored

---

### 🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES

#### **Immediate Code Fixes Required:**

**1. Fix Authentication in `pages/api/projects/[id].ts`:**
```typescript
// REPLACE lines ~77-95 with proper auth pattern:
const token = extractTokenFromRequest(req)
if (!token) {
  const error = createAuthErrorResponse()
  return res.status(error.status).json(error)
}
const userContext = await requirePermission(token, 'MANAGE_PROJECTS')
```

**2. Add Missing Validation Imports:**
```typescript
// ADD to imports in pages/api/projects/[id].ts:
import {
  validateProjectName,
  validateLocation,
  validateDate,
  validateMetadata
} from '@/lib/validation'
```

**3. Apply Input Validation to Updates:**
```typescript
// APPLY validation to updateData object before database operations
```

### 🚫 FINAL QA VERDICT

**❌ NOT APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**

**Status**: **RETURN TO DEVELOPMENT - CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED**

**Critical Issues**: 3 production-blocking bugs identified
**Medium Issues**: 4 stability and consistency problems
**Estimated Fix Time**: 4-6 hours of focused development work

**Recommendation**: **IMMEDIATE DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTION NEEDED**
- Fix authentication system errors in project API
- Resolve server stability issues preventing proper testing  
- Complete input validation implementation across all endpoints
- Implement API testing suite to prevent future regressions

**Re-Test Required**: **FULL REGRESSION TESTING** after critical fixes, focusing on:
1. API endpoint reliability and authentication
2. Server stability under load
3. Complete end-to-end workflow validation
4. Security vulnerability re-testing

**Quality Gate**: This story cannot proceed to production until all critical issues are resolved and full end-to-end testing is completed successfully.
