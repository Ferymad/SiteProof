# Archive: Pre-Untangling Story Structure
**Archive Date**: 2025-08-11
**Archive Reason**: Story structure reorganization to align with updated PRD
**Preserved By**: Scrum Master Bob (sm agent)

## What This Archive Contains

This archive preserves the complete story structure that existed before reorganization to align with the updated PRD epic-based structure.

### ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure

#### `/complex-ai-pipeline-1a2/`
Contains the complete **Story 1A.2: AI Processing Pipeline** implementation with all substories:
- **Production Status**: âœ… DEPLOYED & VALIDATED
- **Key Achievement**: 93.4% transcription accuracy with Irish construction audio
- **Technical Stack**: Next.js + AssemblyAI Universal-2 + Supabase
- **Business Value**: <30s processing, $0.00225 per transcription, professional UX

#### `/clean-mvp-1a3/`
Contains **Story 1A.3: Clean MVP** implementation:
- **Production Status**: âœ… PRODUCTION READY
- **Key Achievement**: Complete human-in-the-loop validation system
- **Workflow**: Audio â†’ Transcription â†’ Suggestions â†’ Validation â†’ Database
- **Performance**: <2 minute validation time, 85% accuracy with construction fixes

#### `/individual-stories/`
Contains standalone stories that don't fit the complex structure:
- Individual story files (1A.1, 1B.1, etc.)
- Django migration plans
- Evidence package generation specs

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Was Archived

### The Problem
- **Conflicting Structures**: Old fragmented approach vs new clean epic structure
- **Naming Inconsistency**: 1A.X format vs 1.X format expected by PRD
- **Scope Fragmentation**: 1A.2 became 9+ substories instead of clean boundaries
- **Status Confusion**: Many "complete" stories didn't align with new Epic phases

### The Solution
- Archive all old work with full preservation
- Map completed implementation to new epic structure
- Create clean story drafts aligned with PRD expectations
- Maintain all technical achievement and QA validation

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Do Not Delete This Archive

This archive contains:
- **Production deployment evidence** and QA validation reports
- **Working implementation details** for advanced AI processing
- **Change logs and development records** showing evolution
- **Performance benchmarks and success metrics**

This work **EXCEEDS** PRD expectations and should be referenced when implementing the new clean structure.
