## Dev Notes

### Ultra-Minimal Tech Stack Focus
This story uses deliberately simplified technology choices for rapid validation:
- **Frontend**: Basic Next.js pages router (not App router complexity)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with minimal components
- **Authentication**: Direct Supabase Auth integration (no complex middleware)
- **Storage**: Direct Supabase storage client calls

### File Locations
- **Pages**: `pages/login.tsx`, `pages/index.tsx`, `pages/upload.tsx`
- **Components**: `components/WhatsAppForm.tsx`, `components/AuthForm.tsx`
- **Configuration**: `lib/supabase.ts` for client setup
- **No complex folder structure needed for validation**

### Authentication Requirements
- Simple email/password only (no company management, roles, teams)
- Direct Supabase Auth usage with minimal wrapper
- Basic protected route for upload form
- No complex user profiles or settings
[Source: epic-1a-core-validation.md#basic-authentication]

### File Storage Specifications
- Single voice note upload per form submission
- Supabase storage bucket: `voice-notes`
- File types: `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.wav`, `.ogg`
- Max file size: 25MB (WhatsApp limit)
- No complex file management or organization needed
[Source: epic-1a-core-validation.md#file-storage]

### Mobile Optimization Focus
- Mobile-first responsive design (375px base)
- Large touch targets for construction site usage
- Simple form layout optimized for phone screens
- File upload that works reliably on iOS/Android browsers
[Source: epic-1a-core-validation.md#mobile-responsive]

### Testing
**Test Requirements:**
- Verify form submission works on desktop and mobile
- Test file upload with various voice note formats
- Confirm authentication flow works correctly
- Test with actual construction site network conditions

**Testing Approach:**
- Manual testing sufficient for validation (no complex test suites)
- Test on real mobile devices used on construction sites
- Verify uploads work on slow/unreliable connections
