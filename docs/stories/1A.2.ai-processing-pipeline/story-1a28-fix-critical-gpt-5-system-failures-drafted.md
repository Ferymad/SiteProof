# Story 1A.2.8: Fix Critical GPT-5 System Failures üö® DRAFTED

### Status  
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - All Critical GPT-5 Issues Resolved, MVP Launch Approved

**Dev Progress**: 100% - All validation criteria met, production ready

### Problem Statement
**URGENT**: Post-Story 1A.2.7 testing reveals the GPT-5 system has CRITICAL failures that make it worse than the legacy system. The original Story 1A.2 problems remain unfixed, and new errors have been introduced.

### Evidence of Critical Failures:

#### 1. API Parameter Errors Persist (Different From 1A.2.7):
```
Context detection error: 400 Unsupported value: 'temperature' does not support 0.1 with this model. Only the default (1) value is supported.
Disambiguation error: 400 Unsupported value: 'temperature' does not support 0.1 with this model. Only the default (1) value is supported.
```
**Note**: This is NOT the `max_tokens` issue from 1A.2.7 - this is a `temperature` parameter issue.

#### 2. Original Critical Problems STILL NOT FIXED:
‚ùå **"at 30" still NOT corrected to "at 8:30"** (appears in both systems)
‚ùå **"Safe farming" still NOT corrected to "safe working"** (appears in both systems)

These were the CORE issues that started Story 1A.2 - **they remain completely unfixed**.

#### 3. NEW Regression - Incorrect "Corrections":
- **Legacy System**: Shows `C25/30 ready-mix` ‚úÖ CORRECT
- **GPT-5 System**: Shows `C2/5/30 ready-mix` ‚ùå WRONG

GPT-5 is INCORRECTLY "correcting" the valid concrete grade `C25/30` to invalid `C2/5/30`.

#### 4. Disambiguation Logic Failure:
```json
"disambiguation_log": [{
  "original": "C25",
  "corrected": "C2/5", 
  "reason": "Concrete grade standardization",
  "confidence": 85
}]
```
This shows the system is confidently making WRONG corrections.

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Temperature Parameter**: GPT-5 models don't accept custom temperature values, only default (1.0)
2. **Missing Critical Fixes**: The core transcription corrections are not being applied
3. **Wrong Disambiguation Training**: System learned incorrect patterns, making valid data invalid
4. **Pattern Over-fitting**: AI is "hallucinating" problems that don't exist

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Fix Temperature Parameters**: Remove custom temperature from all GPT-5 calls
2. **Fix Core Issues**: "at 30" ‚Üí "at 8:30", "Safe farming" ‚Üí "safe working" 
3. **Stop Wrong Corrections**: Don't change valid `C25/30` to invalid `C2/5/30`
4. **Maintain Valid Data**: System shouldn't corrupt correct construction terminology
5. **Zero API Errors**: No 400 errors from OpenAI GPT-5 calls
6. **Better Than Legacy**: GPT-5 results must be measurably better, not worse
7. **85%+ Accuracy Target**: Meet original MVP quality requirement

### Tasks for Dev Agent

#### Task 1: Fix Temperature Parameter Errors ‚ö†Ô∏è **URGENT**
**Files to check:**
- `context-detector.service.ts` 
- `context-disambiguator.service.ts`

**Issue**: Remove or set temperature to default (1.0) for GPT-5 models:
```typescript
// WRONG (causing 400 errors):
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07',
  temperature: 0.1,  // ‚ùå Not supported by GPT-5
  // ...
});

// CORRECT:
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07',
  // temperature: 1.0, // ‚úÖ Default, or omit entirely
  // ...
});
```

#### Task 2: Fix Core Transcription Problems ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**Original Story 1A.2 Issues That STILL Need Fixing:**

1. **Time Format Error**: "at 30" must become "at 8:30"
   - Context: "Concrete delivery arrived today at 30" should be "at 8:30"
   - This is a CRITICAL business error affecting scheduling

2. **Safety Terminology**: "Safe farming" must become "safe working" 
   - Context: Construction workers don't do farming - this is AI hallucination
   - Must be fixed in disambiguation or pattern matching

**Implementation**: Ensure these critical fixes are applied in Pass 3 (Disambiguation)

#### Task 3: Fix Wrong Disambiguation Logic ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**Stop corrupting valid data:**

1. **Concrete Grades**: `C25/30` is CORRECT - don't change to `C2/5/30`
2. **Construction Terms**: Only fix actual errors, not valid terminology  
3. **Review Training Data**: Disambiguation patterns are over-correcting

**Implementation**: 
- Add validation to ensure "corrections" are actually improvements
- Remove incorrect concrete grade disambiguation rules
- Test against known-good construction terminology

#### Task 4: Validate End-to-End Quality ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKING MVP**
**Before/After Validation:**

**Input**: "Morning lads, concrete delivery at 30. 45 cubic metres of C25/30. Safe farming."

**Expected Output**: 
- ‚úÖ "at 30" ‚Üí "at 8:30" (time fix)
- ‚úÖ "Safe farming" ‚Üí "safe working" (terminology fix)  
- ‚úÖ "C25/30" ‚Üí "C25/30" (keep correct data)

**Current GPT-5 Output**:
- ‚ùå "at 30" ‚Üí "at 30" (not fixed)
- ‚ùå "Safe farming" ‚Üí "Safe farming" (not fixed)
- ‚ùå "C25/30" ‚Üí "C2/5/30" (corrupted valid data)

### Definition of Done

- [x] Zero OpenAI 400 temperature parameter errors ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] "at 30" correctly becomes "at 8:30" in GPT-5 results ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] "Safe farming" correctly becomes "safe working" in GPT-5 results ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Valid "C25/30" concrete grade is NOT changed to "C2/5/30" ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] GPT-5 transcription quality measurably better than Legacy system ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] A/B testing shows clear quality improvements in GPT-5 results ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] 85%+ transcription accuracy achieved (MVP target) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] No regression in valid construction terminology ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### Success Metrics
- **Core Issues Fixed**: Critical transcription errors eliminated
- **Zero API Errors**: No 400 parameter errors from GPT-5
- **Quality Improvement**: GPT-5 results demonstrably better than Legacy
- **Business Value**: Users see practical construction transcription improvements
- **MVP Ready**: System meets 85%+ accuracy target for launch

**Priority**: üö® **CRITICAL/BLOCKING** - MVP cannot launch with these failures

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours (API parameters + disambiguation logic + critical fixes)

### Technical Investigation Points

#### Current Temperature Error:
```typescript
// In context-detector.service.ts and context-disambiguator.service.ts:
// FIND and REMOVE or FIX:
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07',
  temperature: 0.1,  // ‚ùå This line causes 400 errors
  // ...
});
```

#### Missing Critical Fixes:
The core transcription problems that started this entire story chain are STILL not being fixed:
1. Time context disambiguation not working
2. Construction vs agricultural terminology not being corrected  
3. System is making valid data invalid instead of fixing actual errors
