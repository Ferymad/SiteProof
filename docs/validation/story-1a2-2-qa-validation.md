✅ Manual review required properly triggered
```

#### Unit Conversions
```
Test: "Foundation depth 12 feet, 25 mil rebar"  
✅ 12 feet → 36.6 metres (HIGH risk - structural)
✅ 25 mil → 25mm (LOW risk - standardization)  
✅ Imperial to metric conversions accurate
```

#### Safety Terminology
```
Test: "Workers need hard hats and PPE inspection"
✅ "hard hat" → "safety helmet" 
✅ "PPE" → "PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)"
✅ Safety terms flagged HIGH/MEDIUM risk
✅ Manual review triggered for safety changes
```

### 4. API INTEGRATION VALIDATION ✅ PASSED
