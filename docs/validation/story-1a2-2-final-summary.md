## 🧪 LIVE SYSTEM VALIDATION

### Real-World Test Scenario
**Input:** Complex construction site report with multiple risk factors
```
"Site inspection complete. Foundation depth 15 feet, concrete delivery 
cost £3,500 including VAT. Workers need hard hats and safety boots for 
tomorrow. Used 25 mil rebar throughout. PPE inspection shows 3 violations. 
Payment due: 2,500 pounds on completion."
```
