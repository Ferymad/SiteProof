# Epic 4: Project Management & Archive

**Expanded Goal**: Enable comprehensive project management workflows with vector-powered search capabilities, data export for business intelligence, and integration readiness for construction software ecosystem.

## Story 4.1: Project Dashboard & Timeline Management
As a PM,
I want a comprehensive project dashboard showing all evidence and communication timelines,
so that I can track project progress and identify documentation gaps.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Project Overview**: Dashboard showing evidence packages, processing status, and timeline view
2. **Timeline Visualization**: Chronological view of all communications and evidence creation
3. **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of documentation completeness and validation status
4. **Mobile Dashboard**: Mobile-optimized interface for on-site project status checking
5. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple user access with role-based permissions per project
6. **Integration Dashboard**: API endpoints for main contractor project visibility

## Story 4.2: Advanced Search & Vector Intelligence
As a PM,
I want intelligent search across all project communications,
so that I can quickly find relevant evidence and identify similar work patterns.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Full-Text Search**: Search across all transcribed communications and extracted data
2. **Vector Similarity Search**: Find similar work descriptions and evidence patterns using Supabase pgvector
3. **Semantic Search**: Natural language search understanding construction terminology
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Automatic identification of potentially duplicate evidence entries
5. **Search API**: REST endpoints for external system search integration
6. **BoQ Intelligence Preparation**: Vector embeddings stored for future BoQ line matching

## Story 4.3: Business Intelligence & Reporting
As a company director,
I want business intelligence reports on documentation patterns and project insights,
so that I can improve operational efficiency and identify revenue opportunities.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Project-level and company-level analytics on documentation efficiency
2. **Trend Analysis**: Historical patterns in communication types, validation rates, and processing times
3. **ROI Reporting**: Time savings calculations and claim success rate improvements
4. **Export Capabilities**: Data export for external business intelligence tools
5. **Predictive Insights**: AI-powered insights on project risk and documentation quality
6. **Integration Analytics**: API access for construction software vendor analytics partnerships
7. **Trust Metrics**: Track user confidence in AI decisions and manual override rates
8. **Adoption Analytics**: Monitor trial-to-paid conversion and feature usage patterns

## Story 4.4: Data Export & Integration Ecosystem
As a construction software vendor,
I want comprehensive API access to construction communication data,
so that I can integrate evidence intelligence into my platform.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Comprehensive API**: Full CRUD operations for all data types with proper pagination
2. **Webhook System**: Real-time notifications for data changes and new evidence creation
3. **Data Licensing**: Structured data export for construction industry research and AI training
4. **Integration SDK**: Developer tools and documentation for third-party integrations
5. **Multi-Tenant API**: Support for white-label partners and construction software ecosystem
6. **Vector API Access**: Semantic search and similarity matching available via API for partners

**Integration Architecture Benefits Embedded Throughout:**
- **Event-Driven Design**: Each epic includes real-time updates and webhook integrations
- **API-First Approach**: Every feature designed with external system access in mind
- **Vector Intelligence**: Semantic search capabilities built into core workflows
- **Multi-Stakeholder Support**: Stories address needs of PMs, main contractors, validators, and compliance officers
- **Platform Readiness**: Architecture supports future white-labeling and ecosystem partnerships
