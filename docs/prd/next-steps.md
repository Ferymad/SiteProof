# Next Steps - Post Story 1A.2.1 Completion

**Current Status**: âœ… Critical transcription accuracy issues resolved via Story 1A.2.1
**Next Priority**: ðŸŽ¯ Evidence Package Generation (Story 1A.3)

## UX Expert Prompt

"Based on this Construction Evidence Machine PRD and completed Story 1A.2.1 enhancements, please create a comprehensive UX design plan focusing on mobile-first interface design for construction site usage. Priority areas: validate the 'WhatsApp-Simple, Bank-Secure' design philosophy through user research with Irish construction PMs, design glove-friendly touch interfaces for outdoor conditions, and create detailed user journey maps for the evidence validation workflow. Ensure WCAG AA compliance with construction-specific accessibility requirements including high contrast for outdoor visibility and simplified navigation for users wearing safety equipment. **UPDATED MVP focus**: business risk assessment displays (replacing fake confidence scores), â‚¬1000+ amount warnings with critical error detection, and browser crash recovery using LocalStorage. Incorporate audio quality indicators and business risk routing status in UI."

## Architect Prompt

"Using this Construction Evidence Machine PRD as foundation and leveraging completed Story 1A.2.1 audio processing enhancements, please design a scalable API-first architecture for the Django + Next.js + Supabase stack. Focus on: event-driven integration architecture supporting main contractor API access, vector search implementation for construction terminology similarity matching, human validation queue scalability for 1 validator per 20 customers, and **enhanced real-time processing pipeline** with audio normalization and business risk routing. Include specific plans for WhatsApp Business API integration, TII-SCD compliance audit trails, and cost-effective scaling from â‚¬45/month MVP to â‚¬170/month at 1000 users. **UPDATED MVP essentials**: implement LocalStorage for state preservation, business risk assessment tracking (replacing confidence scores), audio quality metrics, and progressive enhancement architecture for future features. Integrate AudioNormalizer and BusinessRiskRouter services into the overall architecture."
