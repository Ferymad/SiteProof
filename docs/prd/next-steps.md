# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

"Based on this Construction Evidence Machine PRD, please create a comprehensive UX design plan focusing on mobile-first interface design for construction site usage. Priority areas: validate the 'WhatsApp-Simple, Bank-Secure' design philosophy through user research with Irish construction PMs, design glove-friendly touch interfaces for outdoor conditions, and create detailed user journey maps for the evidence validation workflow. Ensure WCAG AA compliance with construction-specific accessibility requirements including high contrast for outdoor visibility and simplified navigation for users wearing safety equipment. Critical MVP focus: confidence scoring displays, €1000+ amount warnings, and browser crash recovery using LocalStorage."

## Architect Prompt

"Using this Construction Evidence Machine PRD as foundation, please design a scalable API-first architecture for the Django + Next.js + Supabase stack. Focus on: event-driven integration architecture supporting main contractor API access, vector search implementation for construction terminology similarity matching, human validation queue scalability for 1 validator per 20 customers, and real-time processing pipeline for AI transcription with confidence scoring. Include specific plans for WhatsApp Business API integration, TII-SCD compliance audit trails, and cost-effective scaling from €45/month MVP to €170/month at 1000 users. MVP essentials: implement LocalStorage for state preservation, confidence score tracking, and progressive enhancement architecture for future features."
