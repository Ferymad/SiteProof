# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- **Primary**: Reduce PM routine documentation time from 15 hours/week to 2 hours/week through AI-assisted organization
- **Phase 1**: Convert daily site communications (progress reports, safety notes, incident logs) into structured documentation packages
- **Phase 2**: Expand to low-stakes variations and change orders after proving system reliability  
- **Phase 3**: Enable comprehensive evidence packages for high-value claims once trust is established
- **Business**: Achieve €35K monthly recurring revenue (100 customers) within 18 months to enable full-time focus
- **Validation**: Prove concept through own company deployment before external customer acquisition
- **Platform Evolution**: Start WhatsApp integration, evolve to dedicated mobile app for better control

## Background Context

Irish construction subcontractors face a €500M annual market inefficiency caused by fragmented site communication and manual evidence compilation. The Construction Evidence Machine addresses the gap between casual WhatsApp communication and formal BoQ documentation requirements. With 35-45% of variation claims currently rejected due to poor documentation, subcontractors lose €47,633 annually per company through rejected claims, wasted PM time, and delayed payments.

The solution leverages AI-powered voice transcription (Whisper API) and construction-specific natural language processing to automatically organize site communications into TII-SCD compliant evidence packages, with mandatory human validation at every decision point to ensure accuracy in this risk-averse industry.
