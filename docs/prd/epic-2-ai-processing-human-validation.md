# Epic 2: AI Processing & Human Validation

**Expanded Goal**: Build robust AI processing pipeline with construction-specific accuracy improvements and human validation workflows that scale economically while maintaining integration-ready event architecture.

## Story 2.1: Construction-Specific AI Processing
As a PM,
I want voice notes transcribed with high accuracy for construction terminology,
so that technical terms, measurements, and material names are captured correctly.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Construction Prompting**: GPT-4 prompts optimized for construction terminology extraction
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Multi-layered confidence scoring for transcription and data extraction
3. **Error Detection**: Automated flagging of financial amounts >€1,000 and measurement inconsistencies
4. **Data Extraction**: Who/what/when/where extraction from transcribed content
5. **Processing Events**: Supabase real-time events for processing status updates
6. **Integration Events**: Event bus architecture for future main contractor real-time updates

## Story 2.2: Human Validation Queue Workflow
As a validator,
I want an efficient queue management system for reviewing flagged transcriptions,
so that I can maintain 48-hour SLA while ensuring accuracy.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Validation Dashboard**: Django admin-based interface for reviewing flagged items
2. **Audio Playback**: Inline audio player with transcription correction tools
3. **Queue Management**: Priority queuing based on financial amounts and customer tiers
4. **Validation Tracking**: Complete audit trail of human interventions and decisions
5. **Validator Workflow**: Efficient keyboard shortcuts and batch processing capabilities
6. **Integration Hooks**: API endpoints for external validation systems and quality assurance
7. **Confidence Display**: Color-coded confidence indicators (green >90%, yellow 70-90%, red <70%)
8. **Critical Amount Detection**: Automatic flagging and red borders for amounts >€1000

## Story 2.3: AI Model Improvement & Feedback Loop
As a system owner,
I want continuous AI model improvement based on validation feedback,
so that accuracy improves over time and validation costs decrease.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Feedback Collection**: Structured capture of validation corrections and accuracy scores
2. **Model Fine-tuning Data**: Export validated transcriptions for future model training
3. **Accuracy Metrics**: Real-time tracking of AI accuracy by confidence score thresholds
4. **A/B Testing Framework**: Support for testing different AI models and prompting strategies
5. **Integration Analytics**: Data export capabilities for construction industry AI research
6. **Vector Embedding Preparation**: Text embeddings stored for future similarity matching

## Story 2.4: Confidence-Based Routing & Processing Optimization
As a PM,
I want high-confidence transcriptions processed automatically,
so that routine documentation requires minimal manual intervention.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Automated Processing**: >90% confidence items automatically processed without human review
2. **Escalation Rules**: Clear rules for when items require validation based on content and confidence
3. **Processing SLA**: 30-second transcription SLA with 48-hour validation SLA for flagged items
4. **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of multiple voice notes from single WhatsApp session
5. **Real-time Updates**: Live status updates via Supabase realtime for processing progress
6. **Integration Events**: Webhook events for main contractor systems when evidence is processed
