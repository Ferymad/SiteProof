# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
**"WhatsApp-Simple, Bank-Secure"**: The interface should feel as natural as sending a WhatsApp message but inspire the confidence level of online banking. Construction PMs are comfortable with WhatsApp but need professional-grade reliability for business documentation.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Copy-Paste Workflow**: Primary interaction mimics familiar WhatsApp message sharing
- **One-Click Processing**: Single button transforms chaotic messages into structured documentation  
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show simple interface initially, reveal complexity only when needed
- **Mobile-First Touch Targets**: Large buttons optimized for work gloves and outdoor conditions
- **Offline-Ready Interactions**: Cache uploads for later processing when connectivity is poor

## Core Screens and Views
- **Dashboard**: Current projects with processing status and recent activity
- **Message Input**: WhatsApp paste area with drag-drop for voice notes and photos
- **Processing Status**: Real-time progress indicator during AI transcription and analysis
- **Review & Validation**: Split-screen showing original vs processed content for approval
- **Evidence Package Viewer**: PDF preview with edit capabilities before final generation
- **Project Archive**: Searchable history organized by date and project with filtering
- **Settings**: User profile, notification preferences, and data export controls

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Construction sites require robust accessibility due to outdoor conditions, safety equipment, and diverse workforce backgrounds. WCAG AA compliance ensures usability with high-contrast displays, large touch targets, and screen reader compatibility.

**MVP Accessibility Focus:**
- 60px minimum touch targets for gloved hands
- High contrast mode for outdoor visibility (7:1 ratios)
- Simple gestures only (no double-tap or complex interactions)
- Clear confidence indicators for AI-processed content

## Branding
**Industrial Minimalism**: Clean, professional interface that won't intimidate traditional construction users. Color palette inspired by high-vis safety equipment (orange accents) with professional blues and grays. Avoid overly technical or "startup-y" aesthetics that might alienate conservative industry users.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
**Mobile-First Web Application** supporting:
- **Primary**: Smartphones (iPhone/Android) for on-site message capture
- **Secondary**: Tablets for office review and package generation  
- **Tertiary**: Desktop for detailed validation and administration
- **Future**: Native mobile app once user patterns are validated

## Design Validation Framework

**Key Assumptions Requiring Validation:**
1. **Familiar Patterns Over Innovation**: PMs prefer WhatsApp-like copy-paste workflows over drag-drop or advanced UI patterns
2. **Professional Over Trendy**: Conservative design aesthetic builds trust for high-value financial documentation
3. **Construction Site Accessibility**: Outdoor glare, work gloves, safety equipment drive enhanced accessibility requirements
4. **Web-First Adoption**: Reduces installation barriers in IT-restricted construction companies
5. **Trust Through Transparency**: Prominent confidence scores and €1000+ warnings critical for adoption
6. **Recovery Over Prevention**: Simple LocalStorage recovery more valuable than complex error prevention

**Critical Validation Areas:**
- **Screen Size Optimization**: Test evidence package review effectiveness across mobile (5.5-6.7"), tablet (9-11"), and desktop (13"+) displays
- **Outdoor Visibility**: Field test color contrast requirements exceeding WCAG AA (4.5:1) potentially to WCAG AAA (7:1) for direct sunlight readability
- **Glove-Friendly Interface**: Test touch target sizing beyond 44px mobile standard to 60-80px for thick work gloves
- **Offline Functionality Priorities**: Define essential offline capabilities for poor connectivity construction sites (message capture, voice recording, photo storage)

## Epic 1B Wireframe Validation Framework ✅ COMPLETED

**Validation Status**: Comprehensive wireframe validation plan completed for Stories 1.6-1.8 implementation readiness.

**Validation Session Framework:**
1. **Session 1: Unified Input Interface (Story 1.6)** - Validate single-page toggle between WhatsApp text and audio upload
2. **Session 2: MVP PDF Generation (Story 1.7)** - Validate transcription → preview → PDF download workflow  
3. **Session 3: End-to-End Integration (Story 1.8)** - Validate complete <3 minute workflow timing

**Construction-Specific Test Scenarios:**
- **Routine Progress Report** (Low Risk) - 2-minute voice note, <90% confidence auto-processing
- **Safety Incident Report** (Medium Risk) - WhatsApp conversation + photos, safety terminology validation
- **High-Value Variation Claim** (High Risk) - €15,000+ documentation, mandatory human validation

**Validation Success Metrics:**
- **Quantitative**: <3 min workflow, 90% user success rate, 95% glove compatibility, outdoor visibility
- **Qualitative**: "WhatsApp-Simple, Bank-Secure" trust validation, professional PDF credibility

**Ready for Implementation**: UX wireframes validated against PRD requirements, construction PM testing protocols established, Epic 1B validation criteria confirmed.
