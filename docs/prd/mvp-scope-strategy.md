# MVP Scope Strategy

**Primary MVP Approach**: This PRD outlines the complete market validation MVP (90-day timeline) designed to prove product-market fit with construction PMs and establish foundation for customer acquisition.

**Alternative Ultra-Minimal MVP**: For faster technical validation (30-day timeline), see [Ultra-Minimal MVP specification](mvp-minimal-validation.md) which focuses solely on core AI transcription accuracy and PDF generation validation with minimal infrastructure complexity.

**Recommendation**: âœ… **TECHNICAL VALIDATION COMPLETED**
- **Technical Risk Mitigation**: âœ… COMPLETED - AI accuracy validated with Irish construction terminology via Story 1A.2.1
- **Critical Issues Resolved**: âœ… COMPLETED - Audio normalization, business risk routing, critical error detection implemented
- **MVP Unblocked**: âœ… READY - Can proceed with Evidence Package Generation (Story 1A.3)
- **Market Validation**: ðŸŽ¯ READY TO START - Full PRD scope can now be implemented with confidence
- **Trust Building**: âœ… ENHANCED - Business risk assessment replaces unreliable confidence scoring
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ready to add advanced features based on actual usage patterns

**Future Enhancement Roadmap (Post-MVP Validation):**

**Phase 2 Enhancements (Days 31-60):**
- Advanced browser crash recovery with session restoration
- Offline queue for poor connectivity sites
- Adaptive performance for older devices
- Enhanced confidence UI with audio playback integration

**Phase 3 Enhancements (Days 61-90):**
- Progressive Web App with offline-first architecture
- On-premise deployment option for enterprises
- White-labeling capabilities
- Advanced trust features (immutable audit logs, blockchain verification)
- Zero-commitment trial flow with usage-based feature unlocking
