# MVP Scope Strategy

**Primary MVP Approach**: This PRD outlines the complete market validation MVP (90-day timeline) designed to prove product-market fit with construction PMs and establish foundation for customer acquisition.

**Alternative Ultra-Minimal MVP**: For faster technical validation (30-day timeline), see [Ultra-Minimal MVP specification](mvp-minimal-validation.md) which focuses solely on core AI transcription accuracy and PDF generation validation with minimal infrastructure complexity.

**Recommendation**: 
- **Technical Risk Mitigation**: Start with ultra-minimal MVP to validate AI accuracy with Irish construction terminology
- **Market Validation**: Upon technical validation success, implement full PRD scope for customer acquisition
- **Trust Building**: Focus on confidence scoring and â‚¬1000+ amount warnings in MVP
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Add advanced features based on actual usage patterns

**Future Enhancement Roadmap (Post-MVP Validation):**

**Phase 2 Enhancements (Days 31-60):**
- Advanced browser crash recovery with session restoration
- Offline queue for poor connectivity sites
- Adaptive performance for older devices
- Enhanced confidence UI with audio playback integration

**Phase 3 Enhancements (Days 61-90):**
- Progressive Web App with offline-first architecture
- On-premise deployment option for enterprises
- White-labeling capabilities
- Advanced trust features (immutable audit logs, blockchain verification)
- Zero-commitment trial flow with usage-based feature unlocking
