# Critical User Flow: The 10-Minute Friday Workflow

## Timeline Breakdown - Enhanced with Business Risk Routing
```
4:30 PM START → 4:40 PM COMPLETE
├─ 0-2 min: Input (paste messages, upload media folder)
├─ 2-5 min: Enhanced AI Processing (audio normalization + business risk assessment)
├─ 5-8 min: Smart Review (business risk flags highlight critical items first)
└─ 8-10 min: Generate & Download PDF with risk assessment data
```

**Enhancement**: Business risk routing prioritizes high-value/critical items for faster review

## Key Insight: Day-Delayed Reporting Pattern
