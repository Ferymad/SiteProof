# Summary

This UI/UX specification provides comprehensive design guidance for the Construction Evidence Machine MVP, with clear paths for scaling to the full SaaS vision. The design prioritizes the critical "Friday 4:30 PM" use case while building on familiar WhatsApp patterns that construction PMs already understand.

## MVP Design Priorities (30-Day Build)
1. **Core Flow Only**: Input â†’ Process â†’ Review â†’ Download
2. **Trust Indicators**: Confidence scores + â‚¬1000 warnings
3. **Basic Recovery**: LocalStorage for browser crashes
4. **Mobile-First**: 60px targets for construction sites
5. **Demo Mode**: Pre-loaded sample for instant value

## Key MVP Design Decisions:
- **Mobile-first** with desktop working
- **Construction-proof** simplicity (no manual needed)
- **Trust through transparency** (show confidence scores)
- **Evidence-grade** output (professional PDFs)
- **Future-ready** component architecture

## What's NOT in MVP:
- Complex error recovery flows
- Offline mode
- Multiple projects
- Team features
- API integrations
- Advanced customization

The specifications balance immediate MVP validation needs (30 days) with long-term platform growth, ensuring core value is proven before adding complexity.
