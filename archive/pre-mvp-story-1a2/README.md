# Archive: Pre-MVP Story 1A.2 Code

## Date Archived
2025-08-10T17:35:28.631Z

## Reason
Story 1A.2 (AI Processing Pipeline) became overly complex with 11+ sub-stories.
This code is archived as part of the Clean MVP pivot (Story 1A.3).

## Contents

### Services
- advanced-processor.service.ts - GPT-5 complex processing
- transcription-fixer.ts - Pattern matching layer  
- context-analyzer.service.ts - Context detection

### API Endpoints
- context-aware.ts - Broken GPT-5 context endpoint
- transcribe.ts - Original transcribe endpoint

### Components
- SmartSuggestionReview.tsx - Duplicate validation UI
- ProcessingStatus.tsx - Over-engineered status

### Stories
- Various Story 1A.2.x documentation

## Status
These files are preserved for reference but should NOT be used in production.
The Clean MVP (Story 1A.3) replaces this functionality with simpler architecture.

## To Restore
If any of this code is needed, copy from archive back to original location.
However, the Clean MVP approach is recommended over restoring this complexity.
