- Common Irish construction phrases: "crack on", "safe working", "lads", "gear"
- Materials: 7N blocks, 12mm/16mm rebar, ready-mix concrete, shuttering, formwork
- Measurements: metres, millimetres, tonnes, cubic metres (never yards/feet)
- Weather terms: "soft day" (light rain), "lashing" (heavy rain)
- Equipment: teleporter, dumper, JCB, tower crane, pump truck
- Ballymun, Dublin site context with Irish accents and terminology`

Focus on identifying:
1. AMOUNTS: Any monetary values (euros, pounds), quantities, measurements
2. MATERIALS: Construction materials (concrete, steel, timber, blocks, etc.)
3. DATES: Specific dates, deadlines, timeframes mentioned
4. SAFETY: Any safety concerns, incidents, or precautions
5. WORK STATUS: Completion status, delays, progress updates

Context:
- Irish/UK measurement units (metres, millimetres, tonnes)
- Common Irish construction terminology
- Weather-related impacts on construction
- Equipment and machinery names
