# Storage Setup Notes

## Current Status
- ✅ APIs work without storage (graceful degradation)
- ❌ Supabase bucket 'audio-files' doesn't exist
- ✅ Database operations work fine
- ✅ Transcription pipeline works without storage

## To Enable Full Storage (Optional)
1. Go to Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage
3. Create bucket named `audio-files`
4. Set public access for audio file URLs
5. Update RLS policies if needed

## MVP Testing
The current implementation works perfectly for testing without storage:
- Audio files are processed in memory
- Transcriptions are saved to database
- ValidationTool works with transcriptions
- No file persistence needed for core functionality

## Production Considerations
- Enable storage for audio file playback in ValidationTool
- Set up proper bucket policies
- Consider audio file cleanup/retention policies
