# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-core/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-core/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**
   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

2.5 **Smart Story Enhancement Check (for story-draft-checklist only)**
   - If running story-draft-checklist, first analyze the story for external service integrations
   - Load Story Enhancement Engine (.bmad-core/utils/story-enhancement-engine.js) and analyze story content
   - **REF-MCP PATTERN IDENTIFICATION**: For detected external services, identify which current API patterns Dev Agent should fetch to prevent deprecated package usage
   - **CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT STEP**: If external integrations detected but enhancement guidance missing:
     1. Use Story Enhancement Engine to select critical patterns: `selectCriticalPatterns(analysis, storyContent)`
     2. Generate pattern instructions: `await fetchCriticalPatterns(selectedPatterns)`
     3. **ACTUALLY DEPLOY**: Use `formatCriticalPatterns(patternData)` to generate formatted section
     4. **MODIFY STORY**: Add the formatted Critical Implementation Patterns section to the story's Dev Notes
     5. Save the story file with the deployed REF-MCP instructions
   - Include deployment confirmation in Section 6 validation results - verify REF-MCP queries are now present in story document
   - **ROLE SEPARATION**: SM identifies and deploys pattern instructions, Dev Agent fetches and implements during development
   - **DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION**: After deployment, re-read story to confirm REF-MCP instructions are actually present in the document

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:
   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:
   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:
   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ✅ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ❌ FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ⚠️ PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:
   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:
   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures
